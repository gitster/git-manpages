.SH "NAME"
gitattributes \- defining attributes per path
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
$GIT_DIR/info/attributes, \&.gitattributes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
A gitattributes file is a simple text file that gives attributes to pathnames\&.
.sp
Each line in gitattributes file is of form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pattern attr1 attr2 \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
That is, a pattern followed by an attributes list, separated by whitespaces\&. When the pattern matches the path in question, the attributes listed on the line are given to the path\&.
.sp
Each attribute can be in one of these states for a given path:
.PP
Set
.RS 4
The path has the attribute with special value "true"; this is specified by listing only the name of the attribute in the attribute list\&.
.RE
.PP
Unset
.RS 4
The path has the attribute with special value "false"; this is specified by listing the name of the attribute prefixed with a dash
\-
in the attribute list\&.
.RE
.PP
Set to a value
.RS 4
The path has the attribute with specified string value; this is specified by listing the name of the attribute followed by an equal sign
=
and its value in the attribute list\&.
.RE
.PP
Unspecified
.RS 4
No pattern matches the path, and nothing says if the path has or does not have the attribute, the attribute for the path is said to be Unspecified\&.
.RE
.sp
When more than one pattern matches the path, a later line overrides an earlier line\&. This overriding is done per attribute\&. The rules how the pattern matches paths are the same as in \&.gitignore files; see \fBgitignore\fR(5)\&.
.sp
When deciding what attributes are assigned to a path, git consults $GIT_DIR/info/attributes file (which has the highest precedence), \&.gitattributes file in the same directory as the path in question, and its parent directories up to the toplevel of the work tree (the further the directory that contains \&.gitattributes is from the path in question, the lower its precedence)\&.
.sp
If you wish to affect only a single repository (i\&.e\&., to assign attributes to files that are particular to one user\(aqs workflow), then attributes should be placed in the $GIT_DIR/info/attributes file\&. Attributes which should be version\-controlled and distributed to other repositories (i\&.e\&., attributes of interest to all users) should go into \&.gitattributes files\&.
.sp
Sometimes you would need to override an setting of an attribute for a path to unspecified state\&. This can be done by listing the name of the attribute prefixed with an exclamation point !\&.
.SH "EFFECTS"
.sp
Certain operations by git can be influenced by assigning particular attributes to a path\&. Currently, the following operations are attributes\-aware\&.
.SS "Checking\-out and checking\-in"
.sp
These attributes affect how the contents stored in the repository are copied to the working tree files when commands such as \fIgit\-checkout\fR and \fIgit\-merge\fR run\&. They also affect how git stores the contents you prepare in the working tree in the repository upon \fIgit\-add\fR and \fIgit\-commit\fR\&.

\fBcrlf\fR
.RS 4
.sp
This attribute controls the line\-ending convention\&.
.PP
Set
.RS 4
Setting the
crlf
attribute on a path is meant to mark the path as a "text" file\&.
\fIcore\&.autocrlf\fR
conversion takes place without guessing the content type by inspection\&.
.RE
.PP
Unset
.RS 4
Unsetting the
crlf
attribute on a path tells git not to attempt any end\-of\-line conversion upon checkin or checkout\&.
.RE
.PP
Unspecified
.RS 4
Unspecified
crlf
attribute tells git to apply the
core\&.autocrlf
conversion when the file content looks like text\&.
.RE
.PP
Set to string value "input"
.RS 4
This is similar to setting the attribute to
true, but also forces git to act as if
core\&.autocrlf
is set to
input
for the path\&.
.RE
.sp
Any other value set to crlf attribute is ignored and git acts as if the attribute is left unspecified\&.

\fBThe core.autocrlf conversion\fR
.RS 4
.sp
If the configuration variable core\&.autocrlf is false, no conversion is done\&.
.sp
When core\&.autocrlf is true, it means that the platform wants CRLF line endings for files in the working tree, and you want to convert them back to the normal LF line endings when checking in to the repository\&.
.sp
When core\&.autocrlf is set to "input", line endings are converted to LF upon checkin, but there is no conversion done upon checkout\&.
.sp
If core\&.safecrlf is set to "true" or "warn", git verifies if the conversion is reversible for the current setting of core\&.autocrlf\&. For "true", git rejects irreversible conversions; for "warn", git only prints a warning but accepts an irreversible conversion\&. The safety triggers to prevent such a conversion done to the files in the work tree, but there are a few exceptions\&. Even though\&...
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

\fBident\fR
.RS 4
.sp
When the attribute ident is set for a path, git replaces $Id$ in the blob object with $Id:, followed by the 40\-character hexadecimal blob object name, followed by a dollar sign $ upon checkout\&. Any byte sequence that begins with $Id: and ends with $ in the worktree file is replaced with $Id$ upon check\-in\&.

\fBfilter\fR
.RS 4
.sp
A filter attribute can be set to a string value that names a filter driver specified in the configuration\&.
.sp
A filter driver consists of a clean command and a smudge command, either of which can be left unspecified\&. Upon checkout, when the smudge command is specified, the command is fed the blob object from its standard input, and its standard output is used to update the worktree file\&. Similarly, the clean command is used to convert the contents of worktree file upon checkin\&.
.sp
A missing filter driver definition in the config is not an error but makes the filter a no\-op passthru\&.
.sp
The content filtering is done to massage the content into a shape that is more convenient for the platform, filesystem, and the user to use\&. The key phrase here is "more convenient" and not "turning something unusable into usable"\&. In other words, the intent is that if someone unsets the filter driver definition, or does not have the appropriate filter program, the project should still be usable\&.

\fBInteraction between checkin/checkout attributes\fR
.RS 4
.sp
In the check\-in codepath, the worktree file is first converted with filter driver (if specified and corresponding driver defined), then the result is processed with ident (if specified), and then finally with crlf (again, if specified and applicable)\&.
.sp
In the check\-out codepath, the blob content is first converted with crlf, and then ident and fed to filter\&.

\fBDefining an external diff driver\fR
.RS 4
.sp
The definition of a diff driver is done in gitconfig, not gitattributes file, so strictly speaking this manual page is a wrong place to talk about it\&. However\&...
.sp
To define an external diff driver jcdiff, add a section to your $GIT_DIR/config file (or $HOME/\&.gitconfig file) like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[diff "jcdiff"]
        command = j\-c\-diff
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
When git needs to show you a diff for the path with diff attribute set to jcdiff, it calls the command you specified with the above configuration, i\&.e\&. j\-c\-diff, with 7 parameters, just like GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF program is called\&. See \fBgit\fR(1) for details\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBDefining a custom hunk-header\fR
.RS 4
.sp
Each group of changes (called a "hunk") in the textual diff output is prefixed with a line of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
@@ \-k,l +n,m @@ TEXT
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This is called a \fIhunk header\fR\&. The "TEXT" portion is by default a line that begins with an alphabet, an underscore or a dollar sign; this matches what GNU \fIdiff \-p\fR output uses\&. This default selection however is not suited for some contents, and you can use a customized pattern to make a selection\&.
.sp
First, in \&.gitattributes, you would assign the diff attribute for paths\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
*\&.tex   diff=tex
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Then, you would define a "diff\&.tex\&.xfuncname" configuration to specify a regular expression that matches a line that you would want to appear as the hunk header "TEXT"\&. Add a section to your $GIT_DIR/config file (or $HOME/\&.gitconfig file) like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[diff "tex"]
        xfuncname = "^(\e\e\e\e(sub)*section\e\e{\&.*)$"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Note\&. A single level of backslashes are eaten by the configuration file parser, so you would need to double the backslashes; the pattern above picks a line that begins with a backslash, and zero or more occurrences of sub followed by section followed by open brace, to the end of line\&.
.sp
There are a few built\-in patterns to make this easier, and tex is one of them, so you do not have to write the above in your configuration file (you still need to enable this with the attribute mechanism, via \&.gitattributes)\&. The following built in patterns are available:

You can customize the rules that git diff \-\-color\-words uses to split words in a line, by specifying an appropriate regular expression in the "diff\&.*\&.wordRegex" configuration variable\&. For example, in TeX a backslash followed by a sequence of letters forms a command, but several such commands can be run together without intervening whitespace\&. To separate them, use a regular expression in your $GIT_DIR/config file (or $HOME/\&.gitconfig file) like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[diff "tex"]
        wordRegex = "\e\e\e\e[a\-zA\-Z]+|[{}]|\e\e\e\e\&.|[^\e\e{}[:space:]]+"

\fBPerforming text diffs of binary files\fR
.RS 4
.sp
Sometimes it is desirable to see the diff of a text\-converted version of some binary files\&. For example, a word processor document can be converted to an ASCII text representation, and the diff of the text shown\&. Even though this conversion loses some information, the resulting diff is useful for human viewing (but cannot be applied directly)\&.
.sp
The textconv config option is used to define a program for performing such a conversion\&. The program should take a single argument, the name of a file to convert, and produce the resulting text on stdout\&.
.sp
For example, to show the diff of the exif information of a file instead of the binary information (assuming you have the exif tool installed), add the following section to your $GIT_DIR/config file (or $HOME/\&.gitconfig file):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[diff "jpg"]
        textconv = exif
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}

.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.sp
The text conversion is generally a one\-way conversion; in this example, we lose the actual image contents and focus just on the text data\&. This means that diffs generated by textconv are _not_ suitable for applying\&. For this reason, only git diff and the git log family of commands (i\&.e\&., log, whatchanged, show) will perform text conversion\&. git format\-patch will never generate this output\&. If you want to send somebody a text\-converted diff of a binary file (e\&.g\&., because it quickly conveys the changes you have made), you should generate it separately and send it as a comment _in addition to_ the usual binary diff that you might send\&.

which is equivalent to the above\&. Note that the attribute macros can only be "Set" (see the above example that sets "binary" macro as if it were an ordinary attribute \-\-\- setting it in turn unsets "crlf" and "diff")\&.
.SH "DEFINING ATTRIBUTE MACROS"
.sp
Custom attribute macros can be defined only in the \&.gitattributes file at the toplevel (i\&.e\&. not in any subdirectory)\&. The built\-in attribute macro "binary" is equivalent to:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[attr]binary \-diff \-crlf
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
If you have these three gitattributes file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
(in $GIT_DIR/info/attributes)

a*      foo !bar \-baz

(in \&.gitattributes)
abc     foo bar baz

(in t/\&.gitattributes)
ab*     merge=filfre
abc     \-foo \-bar
*\&.c     frotz
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
the attributes given to path t/abc are computed as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
By examining
t/\&.gitattributes
(which is in the same directory as the path in question), git finds that the first line matches\&.
merge
attribute is set\&. It also finds that the second line matches, and attributes
foo
and
bar
are unset\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
Then it examines
\&.gitattributes
(which is in the parent directory), and finds that the first line matches, but
t/\&.gitattributes
file already decided how
merge,
foo
and
bar
attributes should be given to this path, so it leaves
foo
and
bar
unset\&. Attribute
baz
is set\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  3." 4.2
.\}
Finally it examines
$GIT_DIR/info/attributes\&. This file is used to override the in\-tree settings\&. The first line is a match, and
foo
is set,
bar
is reverted to unspecified state, and
baz
is unset\&.
.RE
.sp
As the result, the attributes assignment to t/abc becomes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo     set to true
bar     unspecified
baz     set to false
merge   set to string value "filfre"
frotz   unspecified
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
