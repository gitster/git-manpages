$GIT_DIR/hooks/*
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Hooks are little scripts you can place in $GIT_DIR/hooks directory to trigger action at certain points\&. When \fIgit init\fR is run, a handful of example hooks are copied into the hooks directory of the new repository, but by default they are all disabled\&. To enable a hook, rename it by removing its \&.sample suffix\&.

It is also a requirement for a given hook to be executable\&. However \- in a freshly initialized repository \- the \&.sample files are executable by default\&.
.sp .5v

.sp
This document describes the currently defined hooks\&.
.SH "HOOKS"
.SS "applypatch\-msg"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit am\fR script\&. It takes a single parameter, the name of the file that holds the proposed commit log message\&. Exiting with non\-zero status causes \fIgit am\fR to abort before applying the patch\&.
.sp
The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be used to normalize the message into some project standard format (if the project has one)\&. It can also be used to refuse the commit after inspecting the message file\&.
.sp
The default \fIapplypatch\-msg\fR hook, when enabled, runs the \fIcommit\-msg\fR hook, if the latter is enabled\&.
.SS "pre\-applypatch"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit am\fR\&. It takes no parameter, and is invoked after the patch is applied, but before a commit is made\&.
.sp
If it exits with non\-zero status, then the working tree will not be committed after applying the patch\&.
.sp
It can be used to inspect the current working tree and refuse to make a commit if it does not pass certain test\&.
.sp
The default \fIpre\-applypatch\fR hook, when enabled, runs the \fIpre\-commit\fR hook, if the latter is enabled\&.
.SS "post\-applypatch"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit am\fR\&. It takes no parameter, and is invoked after the patch is applied and a commit is made\&.
.sp
This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the outcome of \fIgit am\fR\&.
.SS "pre\-commit"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit commit\fR, and can be bypassed with \-\-no\-verify option\&. It takes no parameter, and is invoked before obtaining the proposed commit log message and making a commit\&. Exiting with non\-zero status from this script causes the \fIgit commit\fR to abort\&.
.sp
The default \fIpre\-commit\fR hook, when enabled, catches introduction of lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts the commit when such a line is found\&.
.sp
All the \fIgit commit\fR hooks are invoked with the environment variable GIT_EDITOR=: if the command will not bring up an editor to modify the commit message\&.
.SS "prepare\-commit\-msg"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit commit\fR right after preparing the default log message, and before the editor is started\&.
.sp
It takes one to three parameters\&. The first is the name of the file that contains the commit log message\&. The second is the source of the commit message, and can be: message (if a \-m or \-F option was given); template (if a \-t option was given or the configuration option commit\&.template is set); merge (if the commit is a merge or a \&.git/MERGE_MSG file exists); squash (if a \&.git/SQUASH_MSG file exists); or commit, followed by a commit SHA\-1 (if a \-c, \-C or \-\-amend option was given)\&.
.sp
If the exit status is non\-zero, \fIgit commit\fR will abort\&.
.sp
The purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place, and it is not suppressed by the \-\-no\-verify option\&. A non\-zero exit means a failure of the hook and aborts the commit\&. It should not be used as replacement for pre\-commit hook\&.
.sp
The sample prepare\-commit\-msg hook that comes with Git comments out the Conflicts: part of a merge\(cqs commit message\&.
.SS "commit\-msg"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit commit\fR, and can be bypassed with \-\-no\-verify option\&. It takes a single parameter, the name of the file that holds the proposed commit log message\&. Exiting with non\-zero status causes the \fIgit commit\fR to abort\&.
.sp
The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be used to normalize the message into some project standard format (if the project has one)\&. It can also be used to refuse the commit after inspecting the message file\&.
.sp
The default \fIcommit\-msg\fR hook, when enabled, detects duplicate "Signed\-off\-by" lines, and aborts the commit if one is found\&.
.SS "post\-commit"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit commit\fR\&. It takes no parameter, and is invoked after a commit is made\&.
.sp
This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the outcome of \fIgit commit\fR\&.
.SS "pre\-rebase"
.sp
This hook is called by \fIgit rebase\fR and can be used to prevent a branch from getting rebased\&. The hook may be called with one or two parameters\&. The first parameter is the upstream from which the series was forked\&. The second parameter is the branch being rebased, and is not set when rebasing the current branch\&.
.SS "post\-checkout"
.sp
This hook is invoked when a \fIgit checkout\fR is run after having updated the worktree\&. The hook is given three parameters: the ref of the previous HEAD, the ref of the new HEAD (which may or may not have changed), and a flag indicating whether the checkout was a branch checkout (changing branches, flag=1) or a file checkout (retrieving a file from the index, flag=0)\&. This hook cannot affect the outcome of \fIgit checkout\fR\&.
.sp
It is also run after \fIgit clone\fR, unless the \-\-no\-checkout (\-n) option is used\&. The first parameter given to the hook is the null\-ref, the second the ref of the new HEAD and the flag is always 1\&.
.sp
This hook can be used to perform repository validity checks, auto\-display differences from the previous HEAD if different, or set working dir metadata properties\&.
.SS "post\-merge"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit merge\fR, which happens when a \fIgit pull\fR is done on a local repository\&. The hook takes a single parameter, a status flag specifying whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge\&. This hook cannot affect the outcome of \fIgit merge\fR and is not executed, if the merge failed due to conflicts\&.
.sp
This hook can be used in conjunction with a corresponding pre\-commit hook to save and restore any form of metadata associated with the working tree (e\&.g\&.: permissions/ownership, ACLS, etc)\&. See contrib/hooks/setgitperms\&.perl for an example of how to do this\&.
.SS "pre\-push"
.sp
This hook is called by \fIgit push\fR and can be used to prevent a push from taking place\&. The hook is called with two parameters which provide the name and location of the destination remote, if a named remote is not being used both values will be the same\&.
.sp
Information about what is to be pushed is provided on the hook\(cqs standard input with lines of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<local ref> SP <local sha1> SP <remote ref> SP <remote sha1> LF
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
For instance, if the command git push origin master:foreign were run the hook would receive a line like the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
refs/heads/master 67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
although the full, 40\-character SHA\-1s would be supplied\&. If the foreign ref does not yet exist the <remote SHA\-1> will be 40 0\&. If a ref is to be deleted, the <local ref> will be supplied as (delete) and the <local SHA\-1> will be 40 0\&. If the local commit was specified by something other than a name which could be expanded (such as HEAD~, or a SHA\-1) it will be supplied as it was originally given\&.
.sp
If this hook exits with a non\-zero status, \fIgit push\fR will abort without pushing anything\&. Information about why the push is rejected may be sent to the user by writing to standard error\&.
.SS "pre\-receive"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit\-receive\-pack\fR on the remote repository, which happens when a \fIgit push\fR is done on a local repository\&. Just before starting to update refs on the remote repository, the pre\-receive hook is invoked\&. Its exit status determines the success or failure of the update\&.
.sp
This hook executes once for the receive operation\&. It takes no arguments, but for each ref to be updated it receives on standard input a line of the format:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<old\-value> SP <new\-value> SP <ref\-name> LF
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
where <old\-value> is the old object name stored in the ref, <new\-value> is the new object name to be stored in the ref and <ref\-name> is the full name of the ref\&. When creating a new ref, <old\-value> is 40 0\&.
.sp
If the hook exits with non\-zero status, none of the refs will be updated\&. If the hook exits with zero, updating of individual refs can still be prevented by the \fIupdate\fR hook\&.
.sp
Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to \fIgit send\-pack\fR on the other end, so you can simply echo messages for the user\&.
.SS "update"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit\-receive\-pack\fR on the remote repository, which happens when a \fIgit push\fR is done on a local repository\&. Just before updating the ref on the remote repository, the update hook is invoked\&. Its exit status determines the success or failure of the ref update\&.
.sp
The hook executes once for each ref to be updated, and takes three parameters:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
the name of the ref being updated,
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
the old object name stored in the ref,
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
and the new object name to be stored in the ref\&.
.RE
.sp
A zero exit from the update hook allows the ref to be updated\&. Exiting with a non\-zero status prevents \fIgit\-receive\-pack\fR from updating that ref\&.
.sp
This hook can be used to prevent \fIforced\fR update on certain refs by making sure that the object name is a commit object that is a descendant of the commit object named by the old object name\&. That is, to enforce a "fast\-forward only" policy\&.
.sp
It could also be used to log the old\&.\&.new status\&. However, it does not know the entire set of branches, so it would end up firing one e\-mail per ref when used naively, though\&. The \fIpost\-receive\fR hook is more suited to that\&.
.sp
Another use suggested on the mailing list is to use this hook to implement access control which is finer grained than the one based on filesystem group\&.
.sp
Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to \fIgit send\-pack\fR on the other end, so you can simply echo messages for the user\&.
.sp
The default \fIupdate\fR hook, when enabled\(emand with hooks\&.allowunannotated config option unset or set to false\(emprevents unannotated tags to be pushed\&.
.SS "post\-receive"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit\-receive\-pack\fR on the remote repository, which happens when a \fIgit push\fR is done on a local repository\&. It executes on the remote repository once after all the refs have been updated\&.
.sp
This hook executes once for the receive operation\&. It takes no arguments, but gets the same information as the \fIpre\-receive\fR hook does on its standard input\&.
.sp
This hook does not affect the outcome of \fIgit\-receive\-pack\fR, as it is called after the real work is done\&.
.sp
This supersedes the \fIpost\-update\fR hook in that it gets both old and new values of all the refs in addition to their names\&.
.sp
Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to \fIgit send\-pack\fR on the other end, so you can simply echo messages for the user\&.
.sp
The default \fIpost\-receive\fR hook is empty, but there is a sample script post\-receive\-email provided in the contrib/hooks directory in Git distribution, which implements sending commit emails\&.
.SS "post\-update"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit\-receive\-pack\fR on the remote repository, which happens when a \fIgit push\fR is done on a local repository\&. It executes on the remote repository once after all the refs have been updated\&.
.sp
It takes a variable number of parameters, each of which is the name of ref that was actually updated\&.
.sp
This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the outcome of \fIgit\-receive\-pack\fR\&.
.sp
The \fIpost\-update\fR hook can tell what are the heads that were pushed, but it does not know what their original and updated values are, so it is a poor place to do log old\&.\&.new\&. The \fIpost\-receive\fR hook does get both original and updated values of the refs\&. You might consider it instead if you need them\&.
.sp
When enabled, the default \fIpost\-update\fR hook runs \fIgit update\-server\-info\fR to keep the information used by dumb transports (e\&.g\&., HTTP) up\-to\-date\&. If you are publishing a Git repository that is accessible via HTTP, you should probably enable this hook\&.
.sp
Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to \fIgit send\-pack\fR on the other end, so you can simply echo messages for the user\&.
.SS "pre\-auto\-gc"
.sp
This hook is invoked by \fIgit gc \-\-auto\fR\&. It takes no parameter, and exiting with non\-zero status from this script causes the \fIgit gc \-\-auto\fR to abort\&.
.SS "post\-rewrite"
.sp
This hook is invoked by commands that rewrite commits (git commit \-\-amend, \fIgit\-rebase\fR; currently \fIgit\-filter\-branch\fR does \fInot\fR call it!)\&. Its first argument denotes the command it was invoked by: currently one of amend or rebase\&. Further command\-dependent arguments may be passed in the future\&.
.sp
The hook receives a list of the rewritten commits on stdin, in the format
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<old\-sha1> SP <new\-sha1> [ SP <extra\-info> ] LF
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The \fIextra\-info\fR is again command\-dependent\&. If it is empty, the preceding SP is also omitted\&. Currently, no commands pass any \fIextra\-info\fR\&.
.sp
The hook always runs after the automatic note copying (see "notes\&.rewrite\&.<command>" in \fBgit-config.txt\fR(1)) has happened, and thus has access to these notes\&.
.sp
The following command\-specific comments apply:
.PP
rebase
.RS 4
For the
\fIsquash\fR
and
\fIfixup\fR
operation, all commits that were squashed are listed as being rewritten to the squashed commit\&. This means that there will be several lines sharing the same
\fInew\-sha1\fR\&.
.sp
The commits are guaranteed to be listed in the order that they were processed by rebase\&.
