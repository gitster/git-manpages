.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
If \fB\-\-list\fR is given, or if there are no non\-option arguments, existing branches are listed; the current branch will be highlighted in green and marked with an asterisk\&. Any branches checked out in linked worktrees will be highlighted in cyan and marked with a plus sign\&. Option \fB\-r\fR causes the remote\-tracking branches to be listed, and option \fB\-a\fR shows both local and remote branches\&.
.sp
If a \fI<pattern>\fR is given, it is used as a shell wildcard to restrict the output to matching branches\&. If multiple patterns are given, a branch is shown if it matches any of the patterns\&.
.sp
Note that when providing a \fI<pattern>\fR, you must use \fB\-\-list\fR; otherwise the command may be interpreted as branch creation\&.
.sp
With \fB\-\-contains\fR, shows only the branches that contain the named commit (in other words, the branches whose tip commits are descendants of the named commit), \fB\-\-no\-contains\fR inverts it\&. With \fB\-\-merged\fR, only branches merged into the named commit (i\&.e\&. the branches whose tip commits are reachable from the named commit) will be listed\&. With \fB\-\-no\-merged\fR only branches not merged into the named commit will be listed\&. If the \fI<commit>\fR argument is missing it defaults to \fBHEAD\fR (i\&.e\&. the tip of the current branch)\&.
.sp
The command\(cqs second form creates a new branch head named \fI<branch\-name>\fR which points to the current \fBHEAD\fR, or \fI<start\-point>\fR if given\&. As a special case, for \fI<start\-point>\fR, you may use \fI<rev\-A>\fR\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR\fI<rev\-B>\fR as a shortcut for the merge base of \fI<rev\-A>\fR and \fI<rev\-B>\fR if there is exactly one merge base\&. You can leave out at most one of \fI<rev\-A>\fR and \fI<rev\-B>\fR, in which case it defaults to \fBHEAD\fR\&.
.sp
Note that this will create the new branch, but it will not switch the working tree to it; use \fBgit\fR \fBswitch\fR \fI<new\-branch>\fR to switch to the new branch\&.
.sp
When a local branch is started off a remote\-tracking branch, Git sets up the branch (specifically the \fBbranch\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.remote\fR and \fBbranch\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.merge\fR configuration entries) so that \fBgit\fR \fBpull\fR will appropriately merge from the remote\-tracking branch\&. This behavior may be changed via the global \fBbranch\&.autoSetupMerge\fR configuration flag\&. That setting can be overridden by using the \fB\-\-track\fR and \fB\-\-no\-track\fR options, and changed later using \fBgit\fR \fBbranch\fR \fB\-\-set\-upstream\-to\fR\&.
.sp
With a \fB\-m\fR or \fB\-M\fR option, \fI<old\-branch>\fR will be renamed to \fI<new\-branch>\fR\&. If \fI<old\-branch>\fR had a corresponding reflog, it is renamed to match \fI<new\-branch>\fR, and a reflog entry is created to remember the branch renaming\&. If \fI<new\-branch>\fR exists, \fB\-M\fR must be used to force the rename to happen\&.
.sp
The \fB\-c\fR and \fB\-C\fR options have the exact same semantics as \fB\-m\fR and \fB\-M\fR, except instead of the branch being renamed, it will be copied to a new name, along with its config and reflog\&.
.sp
With a \fB\-d\fR or \fB\-D\fR option, \fI<branch\-name>\fR will be deleted\&. You may specify more than one branch for deletion\&. If the branch currently has a reflog then the reflog will also be deleted\&.
.sp
Use \fB\-r\fR together with \fB\-d\fR to delete remote\-tracking branches\&. Note, that it only makes sense to delete remote\-tracking branches if they no longer exist in the remote repository or if \fBgit\fR \fBfetch\fR was configured not to fetch them again\&. See also the \fBprune\fR subcommand of \fBgit-remote\fR(1) for a way to clean up all obsolete remote\-tracking branches\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\fR
.RS 4
Delete a branch\&. The branch must be fully merged in its upstream branch, or in
\fBHEAD\fR
if no upstream was set with
\fB\-\-track\fR
or
\fB\-\-set\-upstream\-to\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D\fR
.RS 4
Shortcut for
\fB\-\-delete\fR
\fB\-\-force\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-create\-reflog\fR
.RS 4
Create the branch\(cqs reflog\&. This activates recording of all changes made to the branch ref, enabling use of date based sha1 expressions such as
\fI<branch\-name>\fR\fB@\fR{yesterday}\&. Note that in non\-bare repositories, reflogs are usually enabled by default by the
\fBcore\&.logAllRefUpdates\fR
config option\&. The negated form
\fB\-\-no\-create\-reflog\fR
only overrides an earlier
\fB\-\-create\-reflog\fR, but currently does not negate the setting of
\fBcore\&.logAllRefUpdates\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
.RS 4
Reset
\fI<branch\-name>\fR
to
\fI<start\-point>\fR, even if
\fI<branch\-name>\fR
exists already\&. Without
\fB\-f\fR,
\fBgit\fR
\fBbranch\fR
refuses to change an existing branch\&. In combination with
\fB\-d\fR
(or
\fB\-\-delete\fR), allow deleting the branch irrespective of its merged status, or whether it even points to a valid commit\&. In combination with
\fB\-m\fR
(or
\fB\-\-move\fR), allow renaming the branch even if the new branch name already exists, the same applies for
\fB\-c\fR
(or
\fB\-\-copy\fR)\&.
.sp
Note that
\fBgit\fR
\fBbranch\fR
\fB\-f\fR
\fI<branch\-name>\fR
[\fI<start\-point>\fR], even with
\fB\-f\fR, refuses to change an existing branch
\fI<branch\-name>\fR
that is checked out in another worktree linked to the same repository\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-move\fR
.RS 4
Move/rename a branch, together with its config and reflog\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M\fR
.RS 4
Shortcut for
\fB\-\-move\fR
\fB\-\-force\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-copy\fR
.RS 4
Copy a branch, together with its config and reflog\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C\fR
.RS 4
Shortcut for
\fB\-\-copy\fR
\fB\-\-force\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-color\fR[\fB=\fR\fI<when>\fR]
.RS 4
Color branches to highlight current, local, and remote\-tracking branches\&. The value must be
\fBalways\fR
(the default),
\fBnever\fR, or
\fBauto\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-color\fR
.RS 4
Turn off branch colors, even when the configuration file gives the default to color output\&. Same as
\fB\-\-color=never\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-case\fR
.RS 4
Sorting and filtering branches are case insensitive\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-omit\-empty\fR
.RS 4
Do not print a newline after formatted refs where the format expands to the empty string\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-column\fR[\fB=\fR\fI<options>\fR], \fB\-\-no\-column\fR
.RS 4
Display branch listing in columns\&. See configuration variable
\fBcolumn\&.branch\fR
for option syntax\&.
\fB\-\-column\fR
and
\fB\-\-no\-column\fR
without options are equivalent to
\fBalways\fR
and
\fBnever\fR
respectively\&.
.sp
This option is only applicable in non\-verbose mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sort=\fR\fI<key>\fR
.RS 4
Sort based on
\fI<key>\fR\&. Prefix
\fB\-\fR
to sort in descending order of the value\&. You may use the
\fB\-\-sort=\fR\fI<key>\fR
option multiple times, in which case the last key becomes the primary key\&. The keys supported are the same as those in
\fBgit-for-each-ref\fR(1)\&. Sort order defaults to the value configured for the
\fBbranch\&.sort\fR
variable if it exists, or to sorting based on the full refname (including
\fBrefs/\&.\&.\fR\&. prefix)\&. This lists detached
\fBHEAD\fR
(if present) first, then local branches and finally remote\-tracking branches\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-remotes\fR
.RS 4
List or delete (if used with
\fB\-d\fR) the remote\-tracking branches\&. Combine with
\fB\-\-list\fR
to match the optional pattern(s)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
.RS 4
List both remote\-tracking branches and local branches\&. Combine with
\fB\-\-list\fR
to match optional pattern(s)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR

\fI<pattern>\fR\&.\&.\&., e\&.g\&.
\fBgit\fR
\fBbranch\fR
\fB\-\-list\fR
\*(Aqmaint\-*\*(Aq, list only the branches that match the pattern(s)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-show\-current\fR
.RS 4
Print the name of the current branch\&. In detached
\fBHEAD\fR
state, nothing is printed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-vv\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
When in list mode, show sha1 and commit subject line for each head, along with relationship to upstream branch (if any)\&. If given twice, print the path of the linked worktree (if any) and the name of the upstream branch, as well (see also
\fBgit\fR
\fBremote\fR
\fBshow\fR
\fI<remote>\fR)\&. Note that the current worktree\(cqs
\fBHEAD\fR
will not have its path printed (it will always be your current directory)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Be more quiet when creating or deleting a branch, suppressing non\-error messages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-abbrev=\fR\fI<n>\fR
.RS 4
In the verbose listing that show the commit object name, show the shortest prefix that is at least
\fI<n>\fR
hexdigits long that uniquely refers the object\&. The default value is 7 and can be overridden by the
\fBcore\&.abbrev\fR
config option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-abbrev\fR
.RS 4
Display the full sha1s in the output listing rather than abbreviating them\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-track\fR[\fB=\fR(\fBdirect\fR|\fBinherit\fR)]
.RS 4
When creating a new branch, set up
\fBbranch\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.remote\fR
and
\fBbranch\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.merge\fR
configuration entries to set "upstream" tracking configuration for the new branch\&. This configuration will tell git to show the relationship between the two branches in
\fBgit\fR
\fBstatus\fR
and
\fBgit\fR
\fBbranch\fR
\fB\-v\fR\&. Furthermore, it directs
\fBgit\fR
\fBpull\fR
without arguments to pull from the upstream when the new branch is checked out\&.
.sp
The exact upstream branch is chosen depending on the optional argument:
\fB\-t\fR,
\fB\-\-track\fR, or
\fB\-\-track=direct\fR
means to use the start\-point branch itself as the upstream;
\fB\-\-track=inherit\fR
means to copy the upstream configuration of the start\-point branch\&.
.sp
The
\fBbranch\&.autoSetupMerge\fR
configuration variable specifies how
\fBgit\fR
\fBswitch\fR,
\fBgit\fR
\fBcheckout\fR
and
\fBgit\fR
\fBbranch\fR
should behave when neither
\fB\-\-track\fR
nor
\fB\-\-no\-track\fR
are specified:
.sp
The default option,
\fBtrue\fR, behaves as though
\fB\-\-track=direct\fR
were given whenever the start\-point is a remote\-tracking branch\&.
\fBfalse\fR
behaves as if
\fB\-\-no\-track\fR
were given\&.
\fBalways\fR
behaves as though
\fB\-\-track=direct\fR
were given\&.
\fBinherit\fR
behaves as though
\fB\-\-track=inherit\fR
were given\&.
\fBsimple\fR
behaves as though
\fB\-\-track=direct\fR
were given only when the
\fI<start\-point>\fR
is a remote\-tracking branch and the new branch has the same name as the remote branch\&.
.sp
See
\fBgit-pull\fR(1)
and
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
for additional discussion on how the
\fBbranch\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.remote\fR
and
\fBbranch\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.merge\fR
options are used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-track\fR
.RS 4
Do not set up "upstream" configuration, even if the
\fBbranch\&.autoSetupMerge\fR
configuration variable is set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules\fR
.RS 4
THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL! Cause the current command to recurse into submodules if
\fBsubmodule\&.propagateBranches\fR
is enabled\&. See
\fBsubmodule\&.propagateBranches\fR
in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&. Currently, only branch creation is supported\&.
.sp
When used in branch creation, a new branch
\fI<branch\-name>\fR
will be created in the superproject and all of the submodules in the superproject\(cqs
\fI<start\-point>\fR\&. In submodules, the branch will point to the submodule commit in the superproject\(cqs
\fI<start\-point>\fR
but the branch\(cqs tracking information will be set up based on the submodule\(cqs branches and remotes e\&.g\&.
\fBgit\fR
\fBbranch\fR
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules\fR
\fBtopic\fR

\fBfetch\fR
the default refspec to be marked for merging in
\fBFETCH_HEAD\fR\&. The value is handled like the remote part of a refspec, and must match a ref which is fetched from the remote given by

\fBpull\fR
