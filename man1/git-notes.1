.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Adds, removes, or reads notes attached to objects, without touching the objects themselves\&.
.sp
By default, notes are saved to and read from \fBrefs/notes/commits\fR, but this default can be overridden\&. See the OPTIONS, CONFIGURATION, and ENVIRONMENT sections below\&. If this ref does not exist, it will be quietly created when it is first needed to store a note\&.
.sp
A typical use of notes is to supplement a commit message without changing the commit itself\&. Notes can be shown by \fBgit\fR \fBlog\fR along with the original commit message\&. To distinguish these notes from the message stored in the commit object, the notes are indented like the message, after an unindented line saying "Notes (\fI<refname>\fR):" (or "Notes:" for \fBrefs/notes/commits\fR)\&.
.sp
Notes can also be added to patches prepared with \fBgit\fR \fBformat\-patch\fR by using the \fB\-\-notes\fR option\&. Such notes are added as a patch commentary after a three dash separator line\&.
.sp
To change which notes are shown by \fBgit\fR \fBlog\fR, see the \fBnotes\&.displayRef\fR discussion in CONFIGURATION\&.
.sp
See the \fBnotes\&.rewrite\&.\fR\fI<command>\fR configuration for a way to carry notes across commands that rewrite commits\&.
.SH "SUBCOMMANDS"
.PP
\fBlist\fR
.RS 4
List the notes object for a given object\&. If no object is given, show a list of all note objects and the objects they annotate (in the format "\fI<note\-object>\fR
\fI<annotated\-object>\fR")\&. This is the default subcommand if no subcommand is given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBadd\fR
.RS 4
Add notes for a given object (defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR)\&. Abort if the object already has notes (use
\fB\-f\fR
to overwrite existing notes)\&. However, if you\(cqre using
\fBadd\fR
interactively (using an editor to supply the notes contents), then \- instead of aborting \- the existing notes will be opened in the editor (like the
\fBedit\fR
subcommand)\&. If you specify multiple
\fB\-m\fR
and
\fB\-F\fR, a blank line will be inserted between the messages\&. Use the
\fB\-\-separator\fR
option to insert other delimiters\&. You can use
\fB\-e\fR
to edit and fine\-tune the message(s) supplied from
\fB\-m\fR
and
\fB\-F\fR
options interactively (using an editor) before adding the note\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcopy\fR
.RS 4
Copy the notes for the first object onto the second object (defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR)\&. Abort if the second object already has notes, or if the first object has none (use
\fB\-f\fR
to overwrite existing notes to the second object)\&. This subcommand is equivalent to:
\fBgit\fR
\fBnotes\fR
\fBadd\fR
[\fB\-f\fR]
\fB\-C\fR
\fB$\fR(\fBgit\fR
\fBnotes\fR
\fBlist\fR
\fI<from\-object>\fR)
\fI<to\-object>\fR
.sp
In
\fB\-\-stdin\fR
mode, take lines in the format
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<from\-object> SP <to\-object> [ SP <rest> ] LF
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
on standard input, and copy the notes from each
\fI<from\-object>\fR
to its corresponding
\fI<to\-object>\fR\&. (The optional
\fI<rest>\fR
is ignored so that the command can read the input given to the
\fBpost\-rewrite\fR
hook\&.)
.sp
\fB\-\-stdin\fR
cannot be combined with object names given on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBappend\fR
.RS 4
Append new message(s) given by
\fB\-m\fR
or
\fB\-F\fR
options to an existing note, or add them as a new note if one does not exist, for the object (defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR)\&. When appending to an existing note, a blank line is added before each new message as an inter\-paragraph separator\&. The separator can be customized with the
\fB\-\-separator\fR
option\&. Edit the notes to be appended given by
\fB\-m\fR
and
\fB\-F\fR
options with
\fB\-e\fR
interactively (using an editor) before appending the note\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBedit\fR
.RS 4
Edit the notes for a given object (defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\fR
.RS 4
Show the notes for a given object (defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmerge\fR
.RS 4
Merge the given notes ref into the current notes ref\&. This will try to merge the changes made by the given notes ref (called "remote") since the merge\-base (if any) into the current notes ref (called "local")\&.
.sp
If conflicts arise and a strategy for automatically resolving conflicting notes (see the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section) is not given, the
\fBmanual\fR
resolver is used\&. This resolver checks out the conflicting notes in a special worktree (\&.\fBgit/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE\fR), and instructs the user to manually resolve the conflicts there\&. When done, the user can either finalize the merge with
\fBgit\fR
\fBnotes\fR
\fBmerge\fR
\fB\-\-commit\fR, or abort the merge with
\fBgit\fR
\fBnotes\fR
\fBmerge\fR
\fB\-\-abort\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBremove\fR
.RS 4
Remove the notes for given objects (defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR)\&. When giving zero or one object from the command line, this is equivalent to specifying an empty note message to the
\fBedit\fR
subcommand\&.
.sp
In
\fB\-\-stdin\fR
mode, also remove the object names given on standard input\&. In other words,
\fB\-\-stdin\fR
can be combined with object names from the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBprune\fR
.RS 4
Remove all notes for non\-existing/unreachable objects\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBget\-ref\fR
.RS 4
Print the current notes ref\&. This provides an easy way to retrieve the current notes ref (e\&.g\&. from scripts)\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
.RS 4
When adding notes to an object that already has notes, overwrite the existing notes (instead of aborting)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR \fI<msg>\fR, \fB\-\-message=\fR\fI<msg>\fR
.RS 4
Use the given note message (instead of prompting)\&. If multiple
\fB\-m\fR
options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F\fR \fI<file>\fR, \fB\-\-file=\fR\fI<file>\fR
.RS 4
Take the note message from the given file\&. Use
\fB\-\fR
to read the note message from the standard input\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C\fR \fI<object>\fR, \fB\-\-reuse\-message=\fR\fI<object>\fR
.RS 4
Take the given blob object (for example, another note) as the note message\&. (Use
\fBgit\fR
\fBnotes\fR
\fBcopy\fR
\fI<object>\fR
instead to copy notes between objects\&.) Implies
\fB\-\-no\-stripspace\fR
since the default behavior is to copy the message verbatim\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR \fI<object>\fR, \fB\-\-reedit\-message=\fR\fI<object>\fR
.RS 4
Like
\fB\-C\fR, but with
\fB\-c\fR
the editor is invoked, so that the user can further edit the note message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-allow\-empty\fR
.RS 4
Allow an empty note object to be stored\&. The default behavior is to automatically remove empty notes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-separator=\fR\fI<paragraph\-break>\fR, \fB\-\-separator\fR, \fB\-\-no\-separator\fR
.RS 4
Specify a string used as a custom inter\-paragraph separator (a newline is added at the end as needed)\&. If
\fB\-\-no\-separator\fR, no separators will be added between paragraphs\&. Defaults to a blank line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stripspace\fR, \fB\-\-no\-stripspace\fR
.RS 4
Clean up whitespace\&. Specifically (see
\fBgit-stripspace\fR(1)):
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
remove trailing whitespace from all lines
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
collapse multiple consecutive empty lines into one empty line
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
remove empty lines from the beginning and end of the input
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
add a missing
\fB\en\fR
to the last line if necessary\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-stripspace\fR
is the default except for
\fB\-C\fR/\fB\-\-reuse\-message\fR\&. However, keep in mind that this depends on the order of similar options\&. For example, for
\fB\-C\fR
\fI<object>\fR
\fB\-m\fR\fI<message>\fR,
\fB\-\-stripspace\fR
will be used because the default for
\fB\-m\fR
overrides the previous
\fB\-C\fR\&. This is a known limitation that may be fixed in the future\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ref=\fR\fI<ref>\fR
.RS 4
Manipulate the notes tree in
\fI<ref>\fR\&. This overrides
\fBGIT_NOTES_REF\fR
and the
\fBcore\&.notesRef\fR
configuration\&. The ref specifies the full refname when it begins with
\fBrefs/notes/\fR; when it begins with
\fBnotes/\fR,
\fBrefs/\fR
and otherwise
\fBrefs/notes/\fR
is prefixed to form a full name of the ref\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ignore\-missing\fR
.RS 4
Do not consider it an error to request removing notes from an object that does not have notes attached to it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stdin\fR

Only valid for
\fBremove\fR
and
\fBcopy\fR\&. See the respective subcommands\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
.RS 4
Do not remove anything; just report the object names whose notes would be removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR \fI<strategy>\fR, \fB\-\-strategy=\fR\fI<strategy>\fR
.RS 4
When merging notes, resolve notes conflicts using the given strategy\&. The following strategies are recognized:
\fBmanual\fR
(default),
\fBours\fR,
\fBtheirs\fR,
\fBunion\fR
and
\fBcat_sort_uniq\fR\&. This option overrides the
\fBnotes\&.mergeStrategy\fR
configuration setting\&. See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section below for more information on each notes merge strategy\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-commit\fR
.RS 4
Finalize an in\-progress

\fBnotes\fR
\fBmerge\fR\&. Use this option when you have resolved the conflicts that
\fBgit\fR
\fBnotes\fR
\fBmerge\fR
stored in \&.\fBgit/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE\fR\&. This amends the partial merge commit created by
\fBgit\fR
\fBnotes\fR
\fBmerge\fR
(stored in \&.\fBgit/NOTES_MERGE_PARTIAL\fR) by adding the notes in \&.\fBgit/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE\fR\&. The notes ref stored in the \&.\fBgit/NOTES_MERGE_REF\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-abort\fR
.RS 4
Abort/reset an in\-progress

When merging notes, be more verbose\&. When pruning notes, report all object names whose notes are removed\&.
.RE
.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
Commit notes are blobs containing extra information about an object (usually information to supplement a commit\(cqs message)\&. These blobs are taken from notes refs\&. A notes ref is usually a branch which contains "files" whose paths are the object names for the objects they describe, with some directory separators included for performance reasons \&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.sp
Every notes change creates a new commit at the specified notes ref\&. You can therefore inspect the history of the notes by invoking, e\&.g\&., \fBgit\fR \fBlog\fR \fB\-p\fR \fBnotes/commits\fR\&. Currently the commit message only records which operation triggered the update, and the commit authorship is determined according to the usual rules (see \fBgit-commit\fR(1))\&. These details may change in the future\&.
.sp
It is also permitted for a notes ref to point directly to a tree object, in which case the history of the notes can be read with \fBgit\fR \fBlog\fR \fB\-p\fR \fB\-g\fR \fI<refname>\fR\&.
.SH "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES"
.sp
The default notes merge strategy is \fBmanual\fR, which checks out conflicting notes in a special work tree for resolving notes conflicts (\&.\fBgit/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE\fR), and instructs the user to resolve the conflicts in that work tree\&. When done, the user can either finalize the merge with \fBgit\fR \fBnotes\fR \fBmerge\fR \fB\-\-commit\fR, or abort the merge with \fBgit\fR \fBnotes\fR \fBmerge\fR \fB\-\-abort\fR\&.
.sp
Users may select an automated merge strategy from among the following using either \fB\-s\fR/\fB\-\-strategy\fR option or configuring \fBnotes\&.mergeStrategy\fR accordingly:
.sp
\fBours\fR automatically resolves conflicting notes in favor of the local version (i\&.e\&. the current notes ref)\&.
.sp
\fBtheirs\fR automatically resolves notes conflicts in favor of the remote version (i\&.e\&. the given notes ref being merged into the current notes ref)\&.
.sp
\fBunion\fR automatically resolves notes conflicts by concatenating the local and remote versions\&.
.sp
\fBcat_sort_uniq\fR is similar to \fBunion\fR, but in addition to concatenating the local and remote versions, this strategy also sorts the resulting lines, and removes duplicate lines from the result\&. This is equivalent to applying the "cat | sort | uniq" shell pipeline to the local and remote versions\&. This strategy is useful if the notes follow a line\-based format where one wants to avoid duplicated lines in the merge result\&. Note that if either the local or remote version contain duplicate lines prior to the merge, these will also be removed by this notes merge strategy\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
You can use notes to add annotations with information that was not available at the time a commit was written\&.
.sp

.if n \{\

.sp
In principle, a note is a regular Git blob, and any kind of (non\-)format is accepted\&. You can binary\-safely create notes from arbitrary files using \fBgit\fR \fBhash\-object\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ cc *\&.c
$ blob=$(git hash\-object \-w a\&.out)
$ git notes \-\-ref=built add \-\-allow\-empty \-C "$blob" HEAD
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
(You cannot simply use \fBgit\fR \fBnotes\fR \fB\-\-ref=built\fR \fBadd\fR \fB\-F\fR \fBa\&.out\fR \fBHEAD\fR because that is not binary\-safe\&.) Of course, it doesn\(cqt make much sense to display non\-text\-format notes with \fBgit\fR \fBlog\fR, so if you use such notes, you\(cqll probably need to write some special\-purpose tools to do something useful with them\&.
