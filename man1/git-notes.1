.SH "NAME"

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fIgit notes\fR [list [<object>]]
\fIgit notes\fR add [\-f] [\-F <file> | \-m <msg> | (\-c | \-C) <object>] [<object>]

.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Adds, removes, or reads notes attached to objects, without touching the objects themselves\&.
.sp
By default, notes are saved to and read from refs/notes/commits, but this default can be overridden\&. See the OPTIONS, CONFIGURATION, and ENVIRONMENT sections below\&. If this ref does not exist, it will be quietly created when it is first needed to store a note\&.
.sp
A typical use of notes is to supplement a commit message without changing the commit itself\&. Notes can be shown by \fIgit log\fR along with the original commit message\&. To distinguish these notes from the message stored in the commit object, the notes are indented like the message, after an unindented line saying "Notes (<refname>):" (or "Notes:" for refs/notes/commits)\&.
.sp
To change which notes are shown by \fIgit log\fR, see the "notes\&.displayRef" configuration in \fBgit-log\fR(1)\&.
.sp
See the "notes\&.rewrite\&.<command>" configuration for a way to carry notes across commands that rewrite commits\&.
.SH "SUBCOMMANDS"
.PP
list
.RS 4
List the notes object for a given object\&. If no object is given, show a list of all note objects and the objects they annotate (in the format "<note object> <annotated object>")\&. This is the default subcommand if no subcommand is given\&.
.RE
.PP
add
.RS 4
Add notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD)\&. Abort if the object already has notes (use
\-f
to overwrite an existing note)\&.
.RE
.PP
copy
.RS 4
Copy the notes for the first object onto the second object\&. Abort if the second object already has notes, or if the first object has none (use \-f to overwrite existing notes to the second object)\&. This subcommand is equivalent to:
git notes add [\-f] \-C $(git notes list <from\-object>) <to\-object>
.sp
In
\-\-stdin
mode, take lines in the format
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<from\-object> SP <to\-object> [ SP <rest> ] LF
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
on standard input, and copy the notes from each <from\-object> to its corresponding <to\-object>\&. (The optional
<rest>
is ignored so that the command can read the input given to the
post\-rewrite
hook\&.)
.RE
.PP
append
.RS 4
Append to the notes of an existing object (defaults to HEAD)\&. Creates a new notes object if needed\&.
.RE
.PP
edit
.RS 4
Edit the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD)\&.
.RE
.PP
show
.RS 4
Show the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD)\&.
.RE
.PP
remove
.RS 4
Remove the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD)\&. This is equivalent to specifying an empty note message to the
edit
subcommand\&.
.RE
.PP
prune
.RS 4
Remove all notes for non\-existing/unreachable objects\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f, \-\-force
.RS 4
When adding notes to an object that already has notes, overwrite the existing notes (instead of aborting)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m <msg>, \-\-message=<msg>
.RS 4
Use the given note message (instead of prompting)\&. If multiple
\-m
options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs\&. Lines starting with
#
and empty lines other than a single line between paragraphs will be stripped out\&.
.RE
.PP
\-F <file>, \-\-file=<file>
.RS 4
Take the note message from the given file\&. Use
\fI\-\fR
to read the note message from the standard input\&. Lines starting with
#
and empty lines other than a single line between paragraphs will be stripped out\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C <object>, \-\-reuse\-message=<object>
.RS 4
Take the note message from the given blob object (for example, another note)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c <object>, \-\-reedit\-message=<object>
.RS 4
Like
\fI\-C\fR, but with
\fI\-c\fR
the editor is invoked, so that the user can further edit the note message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ref <ref>
.RS 4
Manipulate the notes tree in <ref>\&. This overrides
\fIGIT_NOTES_REF\fR
and the "core\&.notesRef" configuration\&. The ref is taken to be in
refs/notes/
if it is not qualified\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-dry\-run
.RS 4
Do not remove anything; just report the object names whose notes would be removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
Report all object names whose notes are removed\&.
.RE
.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
Commit notes are blobs containing extra information about an object (usually information to supplement a commit\(aqs message)\&. These blobs are taken from notes refs\&. A notes ref is usually a branch which contains "files" whose paths are the object names for the objects they describe, with some directory separators included for performance reasons \&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.sp
Every notes change creates a new commit at the specified notes ref\&. You can therefore inspect the history of the notes by invoking, e\&.g\&., git log \-p notes/commits\&. Currently the commit message only records which operation triggered the update, and the commit authorship is determined according to the usual rules (see \fBgit-commit\fR(1))\&. These details may change in the future\&.
.sp
It is also permitted for a notes ref to point directly to a tree object, in which case the history of the notes can be read with git log \-p \-g <refname>\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
You can use notes to add annotations with information that was not available at the time a commit was written\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git notes add \-m \(aqTested\-by: Johannes Sixt <j6t@kdbg\&.org>\(aq 72a144e2
$ git show \-s 72a144e

.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
In principle, a note is a regular Git blob, and any kind of (non\-)format is accepted\&. You can binary\-safely create notes from arbitrary files using \fIgit hash\-object\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ cc *\&.c
$ blob=$(git hash\-object \-w a\&.out)
$ git notes \-\-ref=built add \-C "$blob" HEAD
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Of course, it doesn\(aqt make much sense to display non\-text\-format notes with \fIgit log\fR, so if you use such notes, you\(aqll probably need to write some special\-purpose tools to do something useful with them\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
core\&.notesRef
.RS 4
Notes ref to read and manipulate instead of
refs/notes/commits\&. Must be an unabbreviated ref name\&. This setting can be overridden through the environment and command line\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.displayRef
.RS 4
Which ref (or refs, if a glob or specified more than once), in addition to the default set by
core\&.notesRef
or
\fIGIT_NOTES_REF\fR, to read notes from when showing commit messages with the
\fIgit log\fR
family of commands\&. This setting can be overridden on the command line or by the
\fIGIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF\fR
environment variable\&. See
\fBgit-log\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.rewrite\&.<command>
.RS 4
When rewriting commits with <command> (currently
amend
or
rebase), if this variable is
false, git will not copy notes from the original to the rewritten commit\&. Defaults to
true\&. See also "notes\&.rewriteRef" below\&.
.sp
This setting can be overridden by the
\fIGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF\fR
environment variable\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.rewriteMode
.RS 4
When copying notes during a rewrite, what to do if the target commit already has a note\&. Must be one of
overwrite,
concatenate, and
ignore\&. Defaults to
concatenate\&.
.sp
This setting can be overridden with the
GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE
environment variable\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.rewriteRef
.RS 4
When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully qualified) ref whose notes should be copied\&. May be a glob, in which case notes in all matching refs will be copied\&. You may also specify this configuration several times\&.
.sp
Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to enable note rewriting\&.
.sp
Can be overridden with the
\fIGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF\fR
environment variable\&.
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
\fIGIT_NOTES_REF\fR
.RS 4
Which ref to manipulate notes from, instead of
refs/notes/commits\&. This overrides the
core\&.notesRef
setting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF\fR
.RS 4
Colon\-delimited list of refs or globs indicating which refs, in addition to the default from
core\&.notesRef
or
\fIGIT_NOTES_REF\fR, to read notes from when showing commit messages\&. This overrides the
notes\&.displayRef
setting\&.
.sp
A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that does not match any refs is silently ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE\fR
.RS 4
When copying notes during a rewrite, what to do if the target commit already has a note\&. Must be one of
overwrite,
concatenate, and
ignore\&. This overrides the
core\&.rewriteMode
setting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF\fR
.RS 4
When rewriting commits, which notes to copy from the original to the rewritten commit\&. Must be a colon\-delimited list of refs or globs\&.
.sp
If not set in the environment, the list of notes to copy depends on the
notes\&.rewrite\&.<command>
and
notes\&.rewriteRef
settings\&.
