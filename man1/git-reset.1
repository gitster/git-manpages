.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
In the first three forms, copy entries from \fB<tree\-ish>\fR to the index\&. In the last form, set the current branch head (\fBHEAD\fR) to \fB<commit>\fR, optionally modifying index and working tree to match\&. The \fB<tree\-ish>\fR/\fB<commit>\fR defaults to \fBHEAD\fR in all forms\&.
.PP
\fIgit reset\fR [\-q] [<tree\-ish>] [\-\-] <pathspec>\&..., \fIgit reset\fR [\-q] [\-\-pathspec\-from\-file=<file> [\-\-pathspec\-file\-nul]] [<tree\-ish>]
.RS 4
These forms reset the index entries for all paths that match the
\fB<pathspec>\fR
to their state at
\fB<tree\-ish>\fR\&. (It does not affect the working tree or the current branch\&.)
.sp
This means that
\fBgit reset <pathspec>\fR
is the opposite of
\fBgit add <pathspec>\fR\&. This command is equivalent to
\fBgit restore [\-\-source=<tree\-ish>] \-\-staged <pathspec>\&.\&.\&.\fR\&.
.sp
After running
\fBgit reset <pathspec>\fR
to update the index entry, you can use
\fBgit-restore\fR(1)
to check the contents out of the index to the working tree\&. Alternatively, using
\fBgit-restore\fR(1)
and specifying a commit with
\fB\-\-source\fR, you can copy the contents of a path out of a commit to the index and to the working tree in one go\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIgit reset\fR (\-\-patch | \-p) [<tree\-ish>] [\-\-] [<pathspec>\&...]
.RS 4
Interactively select hunks in the difference between the index and
\fB<tree\-ish>\fR
(defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR)\&. The chosen hunks are applied in reverse to the index\&.
.sp
This means that
\fBgit reset \-p\fR
is the opposite of
\fBgit add \-p\fR, i\&.e\&. you can use it to selectively reset hunks\&. See the \(lqInteractive Mode\(rq section of
\fBgit-add\fR(1)
to learn how to operate the
\fB\-\-patch\fR
mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIgit reset\fR [<mode>] [<commit>]
.RS 4
This form resets the current branch head to
\fB<commit>\fR
and possibly updates the index (resetting it to the tree of
\fB<commit>\fR) and the working tree depending on
\fB<mode>\fR\&. Before the operation,
\fBORIG_HEAD\fR
is set to the tip of the current branch\&. If
\fB<mode>\fR
is omitted, defaults to
\fB\-\-mixed\fR\&. The
\fB<mode>\fR
must be one of the following:
.PP
\-\-soft
.RS 4
Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the head to
\fB<commit>\fR, just like all modes do)\&. This leaves all your changed files "Changes to be committed", as
\fBgit status\fR
would put it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-mixed
.RS 4
Resets the index but not the working tree (i\&.e\&., the changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated\&. This is the default action\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-N\fR
is specified, removed paths are marked as intent\-to\-add (see
\fBgit-add\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-hard
.RS 4
Resets the index and working tree\&. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since
\fB<commit>\fR
are discarded\&. Any untracked files or directories in the way of writing any tracked files are simply deleted\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merge
.RS 4
Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are different between
\fB<commit>\fR
and
\fBHEAD\fR, but keeps those which are different between the index and working tree (i\&.e\&. which have changes which have not been added)\&. If a file that is different between
\fB<commit>\fR
and the index has unstaged changes, reset is aborted\&.
.sp
In other words,
\fB\-\-merge\fR
does something like a
\fBgit read\-tree \-u \-m <commit>\fR, but carries forward unmerged index entries\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-keep
.RS 4
Resets index entries and updates files in the working tree that are different between
\fB<commit>\fR
and
\fBHEAD\fR\&. If a file that is different between
\fB<commit>\fR
and
\fBHEAD\fR
has local changes, reset is aborted\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]recurse\-submodules
.RS 4
When the working tree is updated, using \-\-recurse\-submodules will also recursively reset the working tree of all active submodules according to the commit recorded in the superproject, also setting the submodules\*(Aq HEAD to be detached at that commit\&.

\-\-pathspec\-from\-file=<file>
.RS 4
Pathspec is passed in
\fB<file>\fR
instead of commandline args\&. If
\fB<file>\fR
is exactly
\fB\-\fR
then standard input is used\&. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or CR/LF\&. Pathspec elements can be quoted as explained for the configuration variable
\fBcore\&.quotePath\fR
(see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. See also
\fB\-\-pathspec\-file\-nul\fR
and global
\fB\-\-literal\-pathspecs\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pathspec\-file\-nul
.RS 4
Only meaningful with
\fB\-\-pathspec\-from\-file\fR\&. Pathspec elements are separated with NUL character and all other characters are taken literally (including newlines and quotes)\&.

\fBreset \-\-merge\fR is meant to be used when resetting out of a conflicted merge\&. Any mergy operation guarantees that the working tree file that is involved in the merge does not have a local change with respect to the index before it starts, and that it writes the result out to the working tree\&. So if we see some difference between the index and the target and also between the index and the working tree, then it means that we are not resetting out from a state that a mergy operation left after failing with a conflict\&. That is why we disallow \fB\-\-merge\fR option in this case\&.
.sp
\fBreset \-\-keep\fR is meant to be used when removing some of the last commits in the current branch while keeping changes in the working tree\&. If there could be conflicts between the changes in the commit we want to remove and the changes in the working tree we want to keep, the reset is disallowed\&. That\(cqs why it is disallowed if there are both changes between the working tree and \fBHEAD\fR, and between \fBHEAD\fR and the target\&. To be safe, it is also disallowed when there are unmerged entries\&.
.sp
The following tables show what happens when there are unmerged entries:
