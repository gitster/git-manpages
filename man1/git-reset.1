git-reset \- Reset current HEAD to the specified state
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp

\fIgit reset\fR [\-q] [<tree\-ish>] [\-\-] <paths>\&...
\fIgit reset\fR (\-\-patch | \-p) [<tree\-ish>] [\-\-] [<paths>\&...]
\fIgit reset\fR [\-\-soft | \-\-mixed | \-\-hard | \-\-merge | \-\-keep] [\-q] [<commit>]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
In the first and second form, copy entries from <tree\-ish> to the index\&. In the third form, set the current branch head (HEAD) to <commit>, optionally modifying index and working tree to match\&. The <tree\-ish>/<commit> defaults to HEAD in all forms\&.
.PP
\fIgit reset\fR [\-q] [<tree\-ish>] [\-\-] <paths>\&...
.RS 4
This form resets the index entries for all <paths> to their state at <tree\-ish>\&. (It does not affect the working tree, nor the current branch\&.)
.sp
This means that
git reset <paths>
is the opposite of
git add <paths>\&.
.sp
After running
git reset <paths>
to update the index entry, you can use
\fBgit-checkout\fR(1)
to check the contents out of the index to the working tree\&. Alternatively, using
\fBgit-checkout\fR(1)
and specifying a commit, you can copy the contents of a path out of a commit to the index and to the working tree in one go\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIgit reset\fR (\-\-patch | \-p) [<tree\-ish>] [\-\-] [<paths>\&...]
.RS 4
Interactively select hunks in the difference between the index and <tree\-ish> (defaults to HEAD)\&. The chosen hunks are applied in reverse to the index\&.
.sp
This means that
git reset \-p
is the opposite of
git add \-p, i\&.e\&. you can use it to selectively reset hunks\&. See the \(lqInteractive Mode\(rq section of
\fBgit-add\fR(1)
to learn how to operate the
\-\-patch
mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIgit reset\fR [<mode>] [<commit>]
.RS 4
This form resets the current branch head to <commit> and possibly updates the index (resetting it to the tree of <commit>) and the working tree depending on <mode>\&. If <mode> is omitted, defaults to "\-\-mixed"\&. The <mode> must be one of the following:
.PP
\-\-soft
.RS 4
Does not touch the index file nor the working tree at all (but resets the head to <commit>, just like all modes do)\&. This leaves all your changed files "Changes to be committed", as
\fIgit status\fR
would put it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-mixed
.RS 4
Resets the index but not the working tree (i\&.e\&., the changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated\&. This is the default action\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-hard
.RS 4
Resets the index and working tree\&. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are discarded\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merge
.RS 4
Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are different between <commit> and HEAD, but keeps those which are different between the index and working tree (i\&.e\&. which have changes which have not been added)\&. If a file that is different between <commit> and the index has unstaged changes, reset is aborted\&.
.sp
In other words, \-\-merge does something like a
\fIgit read\-tree \-u \-m <commit>\fR, but carries forward unmerged index entries\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-keep
.RS 4
Resets index entries and updates files in the working tree that are different between <commit> and HEAD\&. If a file that is different between <commit> and HEAD has local changes, reset is aborted\&.

"reset \-\-merge" is meant to be used when resetting out of a conflicted merge\&. Any mergy operation guarantees that the working tree file that is involved in the merge does not have local change wrt the index before it starts, and that it writes the result out to the working tree\&. So if we see some difference between the index and the target and also between the index and the working tree, then it means that we are not resetting out from a state that a mergy operation left after failing with a conflict\&. That is why we disallow \-\-merge option in this case\&.
.sp
"reset \-\-keep" is meant to be used when removing some of the last commits in the current branch while keeping changes in the working tree\&. If there could be conflicts between the changes in the commit we want to remove and the changes in the working tree we want to keep, the reset is disallowed\&. That\(cqs why it is disallowed if there are both changes between the working tree and HEAD, and between HEAD and the target\&. To be safe, it is also disallowed when there are unmerged entries\&.
