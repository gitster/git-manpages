.SH "NAME"
git-rev-list \- Lists commit objects in reverse chronological order
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit rev\-list\fR [<options>] <commit>\&...\: [\-\-] [<path>\&...\:]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
List commits that are reachable by following the \fBparent\fR links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a \fI^\fR in front of them\&. The output is given in reverse chronological order by default\&.
.sp
You can think of this as a set operation\&. Commits reachable from any of the commits given on the command line form a set, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with \fI^\fR in front are subtracted from that set\&. The remaining commits are what comes out in the command\(cqs output\&. Various other options and paths parameters can be used to further limit the result\&.
.sp
Thus, the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git rev\-list foo bar ^baz
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
means "list all the commits which are reachable from \fIfoo\fR or \fIbar\fR, but not from \fIbaz\fR"\&.
.sp
A special notation "\fI<commit1>\fR\fB\&.\&.\fR\fI<commit2>\fR" can be used as a short\-hand for "\fB^\fR\fI<commit1>\fR \fI<commit2>\fR"\&. For example, either of the following may be used interchangeably:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git rev\-list origin\&.\&.HEAD
$ git rev\-list HEAD ^origin
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Another special notation is "\fI<commit1>\fR\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR\fI<commit2>\fR" which is useful for merges\&. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference between the two operands\&. The following two commands are equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git rev\-list A B \-\-not $(git merge\-base \-\-all A B)
$ git rev\-list A\&.\&.\&.B
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fIrev\-list\fR is an essential Git command, since it provides the ability to build and traverse commit ancestry graphs\&. For this reason, it has a lot of different options that enable it to be used by commands as different as \fIgit bisect\fR and \fIgit repack\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Commit Limiting"
.sp
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may be applied\&.
.sp
Using more options generally further limits the output (e\&.g\&. \fB\-\-since=\fR\fI<date1>\fR limits to commits newer than \fI<date1>\fR, and using it with \fB\-\-grep=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches \fI<pattern>\fR), unless otherwise noted\&.
.sp
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as \fB\-\-reverse\fR\&.
.PP
\fB\-\fR\fI<number>\fR, \fB\-n\fR \fI<number>\fR, \fB\-\-max\-count=\fR\fI<number>\fR
.RS 4
Limit the output to
\fI<number>\fR
commits\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-skip=\fR\fI<number>\fR
.RS 4
Skip
\fI<number>\fR
commits before starting to show the commit output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-since=\fR\fI<date>\fR, \fB\-\-after=\fR\fI<date>\fR
.RS 4
Show commits more recent than
\fI<date>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-since\-as\-filter=\fR\fI<date>\fR
.RS 4
Show all commits more recent than
\fI<date>\fR\&. This visits all commits in the range, rather than stopping at the first commit which is older than
\fI<date>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-until=\fR\fI<date>\fR, \fB\-\-before=\fR\fI<date>\fR
.RS 4
Show commits older than
\fI<date>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-age=\fR\fI<timestamp>\fR, \fB\-\-min\-age=\fR\fI<timestamp>\fR
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to specified time range\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-author=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR, \fB\-\-committer=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the
\fI<pattern>\fR
regular expression\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-author=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR, commits whose author matches any of the
\fI<pattern>\fR
are chosen (similarly for multiple
\fB\-\-committer=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-grep\-reflog=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the
\fI<pattern>\fR
regular expression\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-grep\-reflog\fR, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given patterns are chosen\&. It is an error to use this option unless
\fB\-\-walk\-reflogs\fR
is in use\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-grep=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that matches the
\fI<pattern>\fR
regular expression\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-grep=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR, commits whose message matches any of the
\fI<pattern>\fR
are chosen (but see
\fB\-\-all\-match\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-all\-match\fR
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
\fB\-\-grep\fR, instead of ones that match at least one\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-invert\-grep\fR
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that do not match the
\fI<pattern>\fR
specified with
\fB\-\-grep=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-regexp\-ignore\-case\fR
.RS 4
Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter case\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-basic\-regexp\fR
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions; this is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-extended\-regexp\fR
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-fixed\-strings\fR
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don\(cqt interpret pattern as a regular expression)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-perl\-regexp\fR
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl\-compatible regular expressions\&.
.sp
Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional compile\-time dependency\&. If Git wasn\(cqt compiled with support for them providing this option will cause it to die\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-remove\-empty\fR
.RS 4
Stop when a given path disappears from the tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-merges\fR
.RS 4
Print only merge commits\&. This is exactly the same as
\fB\-\-min\-parents=2\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-merges\fR
.RS 4
Do not print commits with more than one parent\&. This is exactly the same as
\fB\-\-max\-parents=1\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-min\-parents=\fR\fI<number>\fR, \fB\-\-max\-parents=\fR\fI<number>\fR, \fB\-\-no\-min\-parents\fR, \fB\-\-no\-max\-parents\fR
.RS 4
Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent commits\&. In particular,
\fB\-\-max\-parents=1\fR
is the same as
\fB\-\-no\-merges\fR,
\fB\-\-min\-parents=2\fR
is the same as
\fB\-\-merges\fR\&.
\fB\-\-max\-parents=0\fR
gives all root commits and
\fB\-\-min\-parents=3\fR
all octopus merges\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-min\-parents\fR
and
\fB\-\-no\-max\-parents\fR
reset these limits (to no limit) again\&. Equivalent forms are
\fB\-\-min\-parents=0\fR
(any commit has 0 or more parents) and
\fB\-\-max\-parents=\-1\fR
(negative numbers denote no upper limit)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-first\-parent\fR
.RS 4
When finding commits to include, follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\&. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-exclude\-first\-parent\-only\fR
.RS 4
When finding commits to exclude (with a
\fI^\fR), follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\&. This can be used to find the set of changes in a topic branch from the point where it diverged from the remote branch, given that arbitrary merges can be valid topic branch changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-not\fR
.RS 4
Reverses the meaning of the
\fI^\fR
prefix (or lack thereof) for all following revision specifiers, up to the next
\fB\-\-not\fR\&. When used on the command line before \-\-stdin, the revisions passed through stdin will not be affected by it\&. Conversely, when passed via standard input, the revisions passed on the command line will not be affected by it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-all\fR

\fBHEAD\fR, are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-branches\fR[\fB=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
\fBrefs/heads\fR
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit branches to ones matching given shell glob\&. If

\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR

.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
\fBrefs/tags\fR
are listed on the command line as

\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-remotes\fR[\fB=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
\fBrefs/remotes\fR
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit remote\-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob\&. If pattern lacks

\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-glob=\fR\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob
\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
are listed on the command line as

\fIrefs/\fR, is automatically prepended if missing\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,

at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-exclude=\fR\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
.RS 4
Do not include refs matching
\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
that the next
\fB\-\-all\fR,
\fB\-\-branches\fR,
\fB\-\-tags\fR,
\fB\-\-remotes\fR, or
\fB\-\-glob\fR
would otherwise consider\&. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to the next
\fB\-\-all\fR,
\fB\-\-branches\fR,
\fB\-\-tags\fR,
\fB\-\-remotes\fR, or
\fB\-\-glob\fR
option (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns)\&.
.sp
The patterns given should not begin with
\fBrefs/heads\fR,
\fBrefs/tags\fR, or
\fBrefs/remotes\fR
when applied to
\fB\-\-branches\fR,
\fB\-\-tags\fR, or
\fB\-\-remotes\fR, respectively, and they must begin with
\fBrefs/\fR
when applied to
\fB\-\-glob\fR
or
\fB\-\-all\fR\&. If a trailing
\fI/*\fR
is intended, it must be given explicitly\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-exclude\-hidden=\fR(\fBfetch\fR|\fBreceive\fR|\fBuploadpack\fR)
.RS 4
Do not include refs that would be hidden by
\fBgit\-fetch\fR,
\fBgit\-receive\-pack\fR
or
\fBgit\-upload\-pack\fR
by consulting the appropriate
\fBfetch\&.hideRefs\fR,
\fBreceive\&.hideRefs\fR
or
\fBuploadpack\&.hideRefs\fR
configuration along with
\fBtransfer\&.hideRefs\fR
(see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. This option affects the next pseudo\-ref option
\fB\-\-all\fR
or
\fB\-\-glob\fR
and is cleared after processing them\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-reflog\fR
.RS 4
Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-alternate\-refs\fR
.RS 4
Pretend as if all objects mentioned as ref tips of alternate repositories were listed on the command line\&. An alternate repository is any repository whose object directory is specified in
\fBobjects/info/alternates\fR\&. The set of included objects may be modified by
\fBcore\&.alternateRefsCommand\fR, etc\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-single\-worktree\fR
.RS 4
By default, all working trees will be examined by the following options when there are more than one (see
\fBgit-worktree\fR(1)):
\fB\-\-all\fR,
\fB\-\-reflog\fR
and
\fB\-\-indexed\-objects\fR\&. This option forces them to examine the current working tree only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ignore\-missing\fR
.RS 4
Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if the bad input was not given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stdin\fR
.RS 4
In addition to getting arguments from the command line, read them from standard input as well\&. This accepts commits and pseudo\-options like
\fB\-\-all\fR
and
\fB\-\-glob=\fR\&. When a
\fB\-\-\fR
separator is seen, the following input is treated as paths and used to limit the result\&. Flags like
\fB\-\-not\fR
which are read via standard input are only respected for arguments passed in the same way and will not influence any subsequent command line arguments\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Don\(cqt print anything to standard output\&. This form is primarily meant to allow the caller to test the exit status to see if a range of objects is fully connected (or not)\&. It is faster than redirecting stdout to
\fB/dev/null\fR
as the output does not have to be formatted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disk\-usage\fR, \fB\-\-disk\-usage=human\fR
.RS 4
Suppress normal output; instead, print the sum of the bytes used for on\-disk storage by the selected commits or objects\&. This is equivalent to piping the output into
\fBgit\fR
\fBcat\-file\fR
\fB\-\-batch\-check=\fR\*(Aq%(\fBobjectsize:disk\fR)\*(Aq, except that it runs much faster (especially with
\fB\-\-use\-bitmap\-index\fR)\&. See the
\fBCAVEATS\fR
section in
\fBgit-cat-file\fR(1)
for the limitations of what "on\-disk storage" means\&. With the optional value
\fBhuman\fR, on\-disk storage size is shown in human\-readable string(e\&.g\&. 12\&.24 Kib, 3\&.50 Mib)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cherry\-mark\fR
.RS 4
Like
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick\fR
(see below) but mark equivalent commits with
\fB=\fR
rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
\fB+\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick\fR
.RS 4
Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the
\(lqother side\(rq
when the set of commits are limited with symmetric difference\&.
.sp
For example, if you have two branches,
\fBA\fR
and
\fBB\fR, a usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
\fB\-\-left\-right\fR
(see the example below in the description of the
\fB\-\-left\-right\fR
option)\&. However, it shows the commits that were cherry\-picked from the other branch (for example,
\(lq3rd on b\(rq
may be cherry\-picked from branch A)\&. With this option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-left\-only\fR, \fB\-\-right\-only\fR
.RS 4
List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric difference, i\&.e\&. only those which would be marked < resp\&. > by
\fB\-\-left\-right\fR\&.
.sp
For example,
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick\fR
\fB\-\-right\-only\fR
\fBA\fR\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR\fBB\fR
omits those commits from
\fBB\fR
which are in
\fBA\fR
or are patch\-equivalent to a commit in
\fBA\fR\&. In other words, this lists the
\fB+\fR
commits from
\fBgit\fR
\fBcherry\fR
\fBA\fR
\fBB\fR\&. More precisely,
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick\fR
\fB\-\-right\-only\fR
\fB\-\-no\-merges\fR
gives the exact list\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cherry\fR
.RS 4
A synonym for
\fB\-\-right\-only\fR
\fB\-\-cherry\-mark\fR
\fB\-\-no\-merges\fR; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
\fBgit\fR
\fBlog\fR
\fB\-\-cherry\fR
\fBupstream\fR\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR\fBmybranch\fR, similar to
\fBgit\fR
\fBcherry\fR
\fBupstream\fR
\fBmybranch\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-walk\-reflogs\fR
.RS 4
Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one to older ones\&. When this option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that is,
\fB^\fR\fI<commit>\fR,
\fI<commit1>\fR\fB\&.\&.\fR\fI<commit2>\fR, and
\fI<commit1>\fR\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR\fI<commit2>\fR
notations cannot be used)\&.
.sp
With
\fB\-\-pretty\fR
format other than
\fBoneline\fR
and
\fBreference\fR
(for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information taken from the reflog\&. The reflog designator in the output may be shown as
\fBref@\fR{\fI<Nth>\fR} (where
\fI<Nth>\fR
is the reverse\-chronological index in the reflog) or as
\fBref@\fR{\fI<timestamp>\fR} (with the
\fI<timestamp>\fR
for that entry), depending on a few rules:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

Additional object metadata, such as object paths or boundary objects, is printed using the
\fI<token>\fR\fB=\fR\fI<value>\fR

.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
<OID> NUL

.SS "History Simplification"
.sp
Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example the commits modifying a particular <path>\&. But there are two parts of \fIHistory Simplification\fR, one part is selecting the commits and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history\&.

The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:
.PP
\fBDefault\fR \fBmode\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR

A more detailed explanation follows\&.

Suppose you specified \fBfoo\fR as the \fI<paths>\fR\&. We shall call commits that modify \fBfoo\fR !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME\&. (In a diff filtered for \fBfoo\fR, they look different and equal, respectively\&.)

In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to illustrate the differences between simplification settings\&. We assume that you are filtering for a file \fBfoo\fR in this commit graph:

\fBrev\-list\fR walks backwards through history, including or excluding commits based on whether \fB\-\-full\-history\fR and/or parent rewriting (via \fB\-\-parents\fR or \fB\-\-children\fR) are used\&. The following settings are available\&.
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed, see
\fB\-\-sparse\fR
below)\&. If the commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent\&. (Even if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them\&.) Otherwise, follow all parents\&.
.sp
This results in:
.sp
.if n \{\

Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is available, removed
\fBB\fR
from consideration entirely\&.
\fBC\fR
was considered via
\fBN\fR, but is TREESAME\&. Root commits are compared to an empty tree, so
\fBI\fR
is !TREESAME\&.
.sp
Parent/child relations are only visible with
\fB\-\-parents\fR, but that does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the parent lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-full\-history\fR without parent rewriting
.RS 4
This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them\&. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get
.sp
.if n \{\

was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents\&.
\fBE\fR,

were all walked, but only
\fBB\fR
was !TREESAME, so the others do not appear\&.
.sp
Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show them disconnected\&.

\fB\-\-full\-history\fR with parent rewriting

Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this can be changed, see
\fB\-\-sparse\fR

Merges are always included\&. However, their parent list is rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included themselves\&. This results in

In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME affects inclusion:

.PP
\fB\-\-sparse\fR

A regular

since
\fBD\fR, in the sense that "what does

have that did not exist in

\fBB\fR
(and
\fBD\fR

.sp
When we want to find out what commits in
\fBM\fR
are contaminated with the bug introduced by
\fBD\fR
and need fixing, however, we might want to view only the subset of
\fBD\fR\fB\&.\&.\fR\fBM\fR
that are actually descendants of
\fBD\fR, i\&.e\&. excluding
\fBC\fR
and
\fBK\fR\&. This is exactly what the
\fB\-\-ancestry\-path\fR
option does\&. Applied to the

.if n \{\

We can also use
\fB\-\-ancestry\-path=D\fR
instead of
\fB\-\-ancestry\-path\fR
which means the same thing when applied to the
\fBD\fR\fB\&.\&.\fR\fBM\fR
range but is just more explicit\&.

If we instead are interested in a given topic within this range, and all commits affected by that topic, we may only want to view the subset of

which contain that topic in their ancestry path\&. So, using
\fB\-\-ancestry\-path=H\fR
\fBD\fR\fB\&.\&.\fR\fBM\fR

Before discussing another option, \fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR, we need to create a new example history\&.

A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is that a commit they know changed a file somehow does not appear in the file\(cqs simplified history\&. Let\(cqs demonstrate a new example and show how options such as \fB\-\-full\-history\fR and \fB\-\-simplify\-merges\fR works in that case:

For this example, suppose \fBI\fR created \fBfile\&.txt\fR which was modified by \fBA\fR, \fBB\fR, and \fBX\fR in different ways\&. The single\-parent commits \fBC\fR, \fBZ\fR, and \fBY\fR do not change \fBfile\&.txt\fR\&. The merge commit \fBM\fR was created by resolving the merge conflict to include both changes from \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR and hence is not TREESAME to either\&. The merge commit \fBR\fR, however, was created by ignoring the contents of \fBfile\&.txt\fR at \fBM\fR and taking only the contents of \fBfile\&.txt\fR at \fBX\fR\&. Hence, \fBR\fR is TREESAME to \fBX\fR but not \fBM\fR\&. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create \fBN\fR is to take the contents of \fBfile\&.txt\fR at \fBR\fR, so \fBN\fR is TREESAME to \fBR\fR but not \fBC\fR\&. The merge commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR are TREESAME to their first parents, but not to their second parents, \fBZ\fR and \fBY\fR respectively\&.
.sp
When using the default mode, \fBN\fR and \fBR\fR both have a TREESAME parent, so those edges are walked and the others are ignored\&. The resulting history graph is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        I\-\-\-X
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
When using \fB\-\-full\-history\fR, Git walks every edge\&. This will discover the commits \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR and the merge \fBM\fR, but also will reveal the merge commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR\&. With parent rewriting, the resulting graph is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
          \&.\-A\-\-\-M\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-N\-\-\-O\-\-\-P

.if n \{\

Here, the merge commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR contribute extra noise, as they did not actually contribute a change to \fBfile\&.txt\fR\&. They only merged a topic that was based on an older version of \fBfile\&.txt\fR\&. This is a common issue in repositories using a workflow where many contributors work in parallel and merge their topic branches along a single trunk: many unrelated merges appear in the \fB\-\-full\-history\fR results\&.
.sp
When using the \fB\-\-simplify\-merges\fR option, the commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR disappear from the results\&. This is because the rewritten second parents of \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR are reachable from their first parents\&. Those edges are removed and then the commits look like single\-parent commits that are TREESAME to their parent\&. This also happens to the commit \fBN\fR, resulting in a history view as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          \&.\-A\-\-\-M\-\-\&.

In this view, we see all of the important single\-parent changes from \fBA\fR, \fBB\fR, and \fBX\fR\&. We also see the carefully\-resolved merge \fBM\fR and the not\-so\-carefully\-resolved merge \fBR\fR\&. This is usually enough information to determine why the commits \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR "disappeared" from history in the default view\&. However, there are a few issues with this approach\&.
.sp
The first issue is performance\&. Unlike any previous option, the \fB\-\-simplify\-merges\fR option requires walking the entire commit history before returning a single result\&. This can make the option difficult to use for very large repositories\&.
.sp
The second issue is one of auditing\&. When many contributors are working on the same repository, it is important which merge commits introduced a change into an important branch\&. The problematic merge \fBR\fR above is not likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an important branch\&. Instead, the merge \fBN\fR was used to merge \fBR\fR and \fBX\fR into the important branch\&. This commit may have information about why the change \fBX\fR came to override the changes from \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR in its commit message\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR
.RS 4
In addition to the commits shown in the default history, show each merge commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent but is TREESAME to a later parent\&.
.sp
When a merge commit is included by
\fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR, the merge is treated as if it "pulled" the change from another branch\&. When using
\fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR
on this example (and no other options) the resulting graph is:
.sp

.fi
.if n \{\

Here, the merge commits
\fBR\fR
and
\fBN\fR
are included because they pulled the commits
\fBX\fR
and
\fBR\fR
into the base branch, respectively\&. These merges are the reason the commits
\fBA\fR
and
\fBB\fR
do not appear in the default history\&.
.sp
When
\fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR
is paired with
\fB\-\-simplify\-merges\fR, the graph includes all of the necessary information:

Notice that since

The \fB\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration\fR option allows you to view only the big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not referenced by tags\&.

If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty\-format is not \fBoneline\fR, \fBemail\fR or \fBraw\fR, an additional line is inserted before the \fBAuthor:\fR line\&. This line begins with "Merge: " and the hashes of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces\&. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the \fIdirect\fR parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file\&.
.sp
There are several built\-in formats, and you can define additional formats by setting a pretty\&.<name> config option to either another format name, or a \fBformat:\fR string, as described below (see \fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. Here are the details of the built\-in formats:

This format is used to refer to another commit in a commit message and is the same as

(\fB%s\fR,

\fB\-\-date=short\fR
unless another
\fB\-\-date\fR
option is explicitly specified\&. As with any
\fBformat:\fR
with format placeholders, its output is not affected by other options like
\fB\-\-decorate\fR
and
\fB\-\-walk\-reflogs\fR\&.

\fBraw\fR
.sp
The
\fBraw\fR
format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit object\&. Notably, the hashes are displayed in full, regardless of whether
\fB\-\-abbrev\fR
or
\fB\-\-no\-abbrev\fR
are used, and
\fIparents\fR
information show the true parent commits, without taking grafts or history simplification into account\&. Note that this format affects the way commits are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e\&.g\&. with
\fBgit\fR
\fBlog\fR
\fB\-\-raw\fR\&. To get full object names in a raw diff format, use
\fB\-\-no\-abbrev\fR\&.

\fBformat:\fR\fI<format\-string>\fR
.sp
The
\fBformat:\fR\fI<format\-string>\fR
format allows you to specify which information you want to show\&. It works a little bit like printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with
\fB%n\fR
instead of
\fB\en\fR\&.
.sp
E\&.g,
\fIformat:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"\fR
would show something like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
The title was >>t4119: test autocomputing \-p<n> for traditional diff input\&.<<

\fB\-\-color\fR, and respecting the

\fB%C\fR(\fBauto\fR,\fI<spec>\fR) is accepted as a historical synonym for the default (e\&.g\&.,
\fB%C\fR(\fBauto\fR,red))\&. Specifying

Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the revision traversal engine\&. For example, the \fB%g*\fR reflog options will insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e\&.g\&., by \fBgit\fR \fBlog\fR \fB\-g\fR)\&. The \fB%d\fR and \fB%D\fR placeholders will use the "short" decoration format if \fB\-\-decorate\fR was not already provided on the command line\&.

The boolean options accept an optional value [\fB=\fR\fI<bool\-value>\fR]\&. The values taken by \fB\-\-type=bool\fR \fBgit-config\fR(1), like \fByes\fR and \fBoff\fR, are all accepted\&. Giving a boolean option without \fB=\fR\fI<value>\fR is equivalent to giving it with \fB=true\fR\&.

If you add a \fB+\fR (plus sign) after \fB%\fR of a placeholder, a line\-feed is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder expands to a non\-empty string\&.
.sp
If you add a \fB\-\fR (minus sign) after \fB%\fR of a placeholder, all consecutive line\-feeds immediately preceding the expansion are deleted if and only if the placeholder expands to an empty string\&.
.sp
If you add a \*(Aq \*(Aq (space) after \fB%\fR of a placeholder, a space is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder expands to a non\-empty string\&.

\fBtformat:\fR
.sp
The
\fBtformat:\fR
format works exactly like
\fBformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\&. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\&. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \e
  | perl \-pe \*(Aq$_ \&.= " \-\- NO NEWLINE\en" unless /\en/\*(Aq
4da45be
7134973 \-\- NO NEWLINE

$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \e
  | perl \-pe \*(Aq$_ \&.= " \-\- NO NEWLINE\en" unless /\en/\*(Aq
4da45be
7134973
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In addition, any unrecognized string that has a
\fB%\fR
in it is interpreted as if it has
\fBtformat:\fR
in front of it\&. For example, these two are equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=%h 4da45bef
