.SH "NAME"
git-log \- Show commit logs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fBgit\fR \fBlog\fR [\fI<options>\fR] [\fI<revision\-range>\fR] [[\fB\-\-\fR] \fI<path>\fR\&...\:]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Shows the commit logs\&.
.sp
List commits that are reachable by following the \fBparent\fR links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a \fI^\fR in front of them\&. The output is given in reverse chronological order by default\&.
.sp
You can think of this as a set operation\&. Commits reachable from any of the commits given on the command line form a set, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with \fI^\fR in front are subtracted from that set\&. The remaining commits are what comes out in the command\(cqs output\&. Various other options and paths parameters can be used to further limit the result\&.
.sp
Thus, the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log foo bar ^baz
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
means "list all the commits which are reachable from \fIfoo\fR or \fIbar\fR, but not from \fIbaz\fR"\&.
.sp
A special notation "\fI<commit1>\fR\fB\&.\&.\fR\fI<commit2>\fR" can be used as a short\-hand for "\fB^\fR\fI<commit1>\fR \fI<commit2>\fR"\&. For example, either of the following may be used interchangeably:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log origin\&.\&.HEAD
$ git log HEAD ^origin
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Another special notation is "\fI<commit1>\fR\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR\fI<commit2>\fR" which is useful for merges\&. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference between the two operands\&. The following two commands are equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log A B \-\-not $(git merge\-base \-\-all A B)
$ git log A\&.\&.\&.B
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The command takes options applicable to the \fBgit-rev-list\fR(1) command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the \fBgit-diff\fR(1) command to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-follow\fR
.RS 4
Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a single file)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-decorate\fR, \fB\-\-decorate\fR[\fB=\fR(\fBshort\fR|\fBfull\fR|\fBauto\fR|\fBno\fR)]
.RS 4
Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown\&. Possible values are:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
`short`;; the ref name prefixes `refs/heads/`, `refs/tags/` and
        `refs/remotes/` are not printed\&.
`full`;; the full ref name (including prefix) is printed\&.
`auto`:: if the output is going to a terminal, the ref names
        are shown as if `short` were given, otherwise no ref names are
        shown\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The option
\fB\-\-decorate\fR
is short\-hand for
\fB\-\-decorate=short\fR\&. Default to configuration value of
\fBlog\&.decorate\fR
if configured, otherwise,
\fBauto\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR, \fB\-\-decorate\-refs\-exclude=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR
.RS 4
For each candidate reference, do not use it for decoration if it matches any of the
\fI<pattern>\fR
parameters given to
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\-exclude\fR
or if it doesn\(cqt match any of the
\fI<pattern>\fR
parameters given to
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\fR\&. The
\fBlog\&.excludeDecoration\fR
config option allows excluding refs from the decorations, but an explicit
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\fR
pattern will override a match in
\fBlog\&.excludeDecoration\fR\&.
.sp
If none of these options or config settings are given, then references are used as decoration if they match
\fBHEAD\fR,
\fBrefs/heads/\fR,
\fBrefs/remotes/\fR,
\fBrefs/stash/\fR, or
\fBrefs/tags/\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-clear\-decorations\fR
.RS 4
When specified, this option clears all previous
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\fR
or
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\-exclude\fR
options and relaxes the default decoration filter to include all references\&. This option is assumed if the config value
\fBlog\&.initialDecorationSet\fR
is set to
\fBall\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-source\fR
.RS 4
Print out the ref name given on the command line by which each commit was reached\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-mailmap\fR, \fB\-\-no\-mailmap\fR, \fB\-\-use\-mailmap\fR, \fB\-\-no\-use\-mailmap\fR
.RS 4
Use mailmap file to map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical real names and email addresses\&. See
\fBgit-shortlog\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-full\-diff\fR
.RS 4
Without this flag,
\fBgit\fR
\fBlog\fR
\fB\-p\fR
\fI<path>\fR\&.\&.\&. shows commits that touch the specified paths, and diffs about the same specified paths\&. With this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified paths; this means that "\fI<path>\fR\&.\&.\&." limits only commits, and doesn\(cqt limit diff for those commits\&.
.sp
Note that this affects all diff\-based output types, e\&.g\&. those produced by
\fB\-\-stat\fR, etc\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-log\-size\fR
.RS 4
Include a line
\fBlog\fR
\fBsize\fR
\fI<number>\fR
in the output for each commit, where
\fI<number>\fR
is the length of that commit\(cqs message in bytes\&. Intended to speed up tools that read log messages from
\fBgit\fR
\fBlog\fR
output by allowing them to allocate space in advance\&.
.RE

\fB\-L\fR\fI<start>\fR\fB,\fR\fI<end>\fR\fB:\fR\fI<file>\fR, \fB\-L:\fR\fI<funcname>\fR\fB:\fR\fI<file>\fR
.RS 4
Trace the evolution of the line range given by
\fI<start>\fR\fB,\fR\fI<end>\fR, or by the function name regex
\fI<funcname>\fR, within the
\fI<file>\fR\&. You may not give any pathspec limiters\&. This is currently limited to a walk starting from a single revision, i\&.e\&., you may only give zero or one positive revision arguments, and
\fI<start>\fR
and
\fI<end>\fR
(or
\fI<funcname>\fR) must exist in the starting revision\&. You can specify this option more than once\&. Implies
\fB\-\-patch\fR\&. Patch output can be suppressed using
\fB\-\-no\-patch\fR, but other diff formats (namely
\fB\-\-raw\fR,
\fB\-\-numstat\fR,
\fB\-\-shortstat\fR,
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR,
\fB\-\-summary\fR,
\fB\-\-name\-only\fR,
\fB\-\-name\-status\fR,
\fB\-\-check\fR) are not currently implemented\&.
.sp
\fI<start>\fR
and
\fI<end>\fR
can take one of these forms:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fI<number>\fR
.sp
If
\fI<start>\fR
or
\fI<end>\fR
is a number, it specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1)\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fB/\fR\fI<regex>\fR\fB/\fR
.sp
This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX
\fI<regex>\fR\&. If
\fI<start>\fR
is a regex, it will search from the end of the previous
\fB\-L\fR
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&. If
\fI<start>\fR
is
\fB^/\fR\fI<regex>\fR\fB/\fR, it will search from the start of file\&. If
\fI<end>\fR
is a regex, it will search starting at the line given by
\fI<start>\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fB+\fR\fI<offset>\fR
or
\fB\-\fR\fI<offset>\fR
.sp
This is only valid for
\fI<end>\fR
and will specify a number of lines before or after the line given by
\fI<start>\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
If
\fB:\fR\fI<funcname>\fR
is given in place of
\fI<start>\fR
and
\fI<end>\fR, it is a regular expression that denotes the range from the first funcname line that matches
\fI<funcname>\fR, up to the next funcname line\&.
\fB:\fR\fI<funcname>\fR
searches from the end of the previous
\fB\-L\fR
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&.
\fB^:\fR\fI<funcname>\fR
searches from the start of file\&. The function names are determined in the same way as
\fBgit\fR
\fBdiff\fR
works out patch hunk headers (see
\fIDefining a custom hunk\-header\fR
in
\fBgitattributes\fR(5))\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI<revision\-range>\fR
.RS 4
Show only commits in the specified revision range\&. When no
\fI<revision\-range>\fR
is specified, it defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR
(i\&.e\&. the whole history leading to the current commit)\&.
\fBorigin\fR\fB\&.\&.\fR\fBHEAD\fR
specifies all the commits reachable from the current commit (i\&.e\&.
\fBHEAD\fR), but not from
\fBorigin\fR\&. For a complete list of ways to spell
\fI<revision\-range>\fR, see the
\fISpecifying Ranges\fR
section of
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.
.RE
.PP
[\fB\-\-\fR] \fI<path>\fR\&.\&.\&.
.RS 4
Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the specified paths came to be\&. See
\fIHistory Simplification\fR
below for details and other simplification modes\&.
.sp
Paths may need to be prefixed with
\fB\-\-\fR
to separate them from options or the revision range, when confusion arises\&.
.RE
.SS "Commit Limiting"
.sp
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may be applied\&.
.sp
Using more options generally further limits the output (e\&.g\&. \fB\-\-since=\fR\fI<date1>\fR limits to commits newer than \fI<date1>\fR, and using it with \fB\-\-grep=\fR\fI<pattern>\fR further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches \fI<pattern>\fR), unless otherwise noted\&.
.sp
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as \fB\-\-reverse\fR\&.

When finding commits to include, follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\&. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge\&.

Here, the merge commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR contribute extra noise, as they did not actually contribute a change to \fBfile\&.txt\fR\&. They only merged a topic that was based on an older version of \fBfile\&.txt\fR\&. This is a common issue in repositories using a workflow where many contributors work in parallel and merge their topic branches along a single trunk: many unrelated merges appear in the \fB\-\-full\-history\fR results\&.
.sp
When using the \fB\-\-simplify\-merges\fR option, the commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR disappear from the results\&. This is because the rewritten second parents of \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR are reachable from their first parents\&. Those edges are removed and then the commits look like single\-parent commits that are TREESAME to their parent\&. This also happens to the commit \fBN\fR, resulting in a history view as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          \&.\-A\-\-\-M\-\-\&.
         /     /    \e

In this view, we see all of the important single\-parent changes from \fBA\fR, \fBB\fR, and \fBX\fR\&. We also see the carefully\-resolved merge \fBM\fR and the not\-so\-carefully\-resolved merge \fBR\fR\&. This is usually enough information to determine why the commits \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR "disappeared" from history in the default view\&. However, there are a few issues with this approach\&.
.sp
The first issue is performance\&. Unlike any previous option, the \fB\-\-simplify\-merges\fR option requires walking the entire commit history before returning a single result\&. This can make the option difficult to use for very large repositories\&.
.sp
The second issue is one of auditing\&. When many contributors are working on the same repository, it is important which merge commits introduced a change into an important branch\&. The problematic merge \fBR\fR above is not likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an important branch\&. Instead, the merge \fBN\fR was used to merge \fBR\fR and \fBX\fR into the important branch\&. This commit may have information about why the change \fBX\fR came to override the changes from \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR in its commit message\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR
.RS 4
In addition to the commits shown in the default history, show each merge commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent but is TREESAME to a later parent\&.
.sp
When a merge commit is included by
\fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR, the merge is treated as if it "pulled" the change from another branch\&. When using
\fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR
on this example (and no other options) the resulting graph is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        I\-\-\-X\-\-\-R\-\-\-N
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
Here, the merge commits
\fBR\fR
and
\fBN\fR
are included because they pulled the commits
\fBX\fR
and
\fBR\fR
into the base branch, respectively\&. These merges are the reason the commits
\fBA\fR
and
\fBB\fR
do not appear in the default history\&.
.sp
When
\fB\-\-show\-pulls\fR
is paired with
\fB\-\-simplify\-merges\fR, the graph includes all of the necessary information:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

Notice that since
\fBM\fR
is reachable from
\fBR\fR, the edge from
\fBN\fR
to
\fBM\fR
was simplified away\&. However,
\fBN\fR
still appears in the history as an important commit because it "pulled" the change
\fBR\fR
into the main branch\&.
.RE
.sp
The \fB\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration\fR option allows you to view only the big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not referenced by tags\&. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words, kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given on the command line\&. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified away)\&.

With

This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \e

.sp
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
\fI<m>\fR
controls this aspect of the
\fB\-B\fR
option (defaults to 60%)\&.
\fB\-B/70%\fR
specifies that less than 30% of the original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i\&.e\&. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines)\&.
.sp
When used with
\fB\-M\fR, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually
\fB\-M\fR
only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
\fI<n>\fR
controls this aspect of the
\fB\-B\fR
option (defaults to 50%)\&.
\fB\-B20%\fR
specifies that a change with addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file\(cqs size are eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another file\&.

\fB\-M\fR[\fI<n>\fR], \fB\-\-find\-renames\fR[\fB=\fR\fI<n>\fR]
.RS 4
If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit\&. For following files across renames while traversing history, see
\fB\-\-follow\fR\&. If
\fI<n>\fR
is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i\&.e\&. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file\(cqs size)\&. For example,
\fB\-M90%\fR
means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn\(cqt changed\&. Without a
\fB%\fR
sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it\&. I\&.e\&.,
\fB\-M5\fR
becomes 0\&.5, and is thus the same as
\fB\-M50%\fR\&. Similarly,
\fB\-M05\fR
is the same as
\fB\-M5%\fR\&. To limit detection to exact renames, use
\fB\-M100%\fR\&. The default similarity index is 50%\&.

\fB\-\-find\-copies\-harder\fR
.RS 4
For performance reasons, by default,
\fB\-C\fR
option finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset\&. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy\&. This is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it with caution\&. Giving more than one
\fB\-C\fR

Omit the preimage for deletes, i\&.e\&. print only the header but not the diff between the preimage and

\fBpatch\fR

\fBgit\fR
\fBapply\fR; this is solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the change\&. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the option\&.

.RS 4
The

options involve some preliminary steps that can detect subsets of renames/copies cheaply, followed by an exhaustive fallback portion that compares all remaining unpaired destinations to all relevant sources\&. (For renames, only remaining unpaired sources are relevant; for copies, all original sources are relevant\&.) For N sources and destinations, this exhaustive check is O(N^2)\&. This option prevents the exhaustive portion of rename/copy detection from running if the number of source/destination files involved exceeds the specified number\&. Defaults to
\fBdiff\&.renameLimit\fR\&. Note that a value of 0 is treated as unlimited\&.

Similar to the two\-line header for the traditional

However, if the \-\-combined\-all\-paths option is provided, instead of a two\-line from\-file/to\-file, you get an N+1 line from\-file/to\-file header, where N is the number of parents in the merge commit:

Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to

Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \fB\-\fR (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), \fB+\fR (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or " " (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&...\: with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\&. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\(cqs line is different from it\&.
.sp
A \fB\-\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\&. A \fB+\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\&.
.sp
In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \fB\-\fR removals from both file1 and file2, plus \fB++\fR to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or file2)\&. Also, eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with \fB+\fR)\&.
.sp
When shown by \fBgit\fR \fBdiff\-tree\fR \fB\-c\fR, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i\&.e\&. file1\&.\&.fileN are the parents)\&. When shown by \fBgit\fR \fBdiff\-files\fR \fB\-c\fR, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file (i\&.e\&. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their version")\&.

Path names are encoded in UTF\-8 normalization form C\&. This applies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as path names in command line arguments, environment variables and config files (\&.\fBgit/config\fR

.sp
Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of non\-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions (except on Mac and Windows)\&. Therefore, using non\-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended ASCII encodings\&. However, repositories created on such systems will not work properly on UTF\-8\-based systems (e\&.g\&. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa\&. Additionally, many Git\-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF\-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly\&.

Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF\-8, but other extended ASCII encodings are also supported\&. This includes ISO\-8859\-x, CP125x and many others, but

Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF\-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF\-8 on projects\&. If all participants of a particular project find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it\&. However, there are a few things to keep in mind\&.
