.SH "NAME"
git-log \- Show commit logs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit log\fR [<options>] [<revision\-range>] [[\-\-] <path>\&...]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Shows the commit logs\&.
.sp
List commits that are reachable by following the \fBparent\fR links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a \fI^\fR in front of them\&. The output is given in reverse chronological order by default\&.
.sp
You can think of this as a set operation\&. Commits reachable from any of the commits given on the command line form a set, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with \fI^\fR in front are subtracted from that set\&. The remaining commits are what comes out in the command\(cqs output\&. Various other options and paths parameters can be used to further limit the result\&.
.sp
Thus, the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log foo bar ^baz
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
means "list all the commits which are reachable from \fIfoo\fR or \fIbar\fR, but not from \fIbaz\fR"\&.
.sp
A special notation "\fI<commit1>\fR\&.\&.\fI<commit2>\fR" can be used as a short\-hand for "^\fI<commit1>\fR \fI<commit2>\fR"\&. For example, either of the following may be used interchangeably:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log origin\&.\&.HEAD
$ git log HEAD ^origin
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Another special notation is "\fI<commit1>\fR\&...\fI<commit2>\fR" which is useful for merges\&. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference between the two operands\&. The following two commands are equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log A B \-\-not $(git merge\-base \-\-all A B)
$ git log A\&.\&.\&.B
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The command takes options applicable to the \fBgit-rev-list\fR(1) command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the \fBgit-diff\fR(1) command to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-follow
.RS 4
Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a single file)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-decorate, \-\-decorate[=short|full|auto|no]
.RS 4
Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown\&. If
\fIshort\fR
is specified, the ref name prefixes
\fIrefs/heads/\fR,
\fIrefs/tags/\fR
and
\fIrefs/remotes/\fR
will not be printed\&. If
\fIfull\fR
is specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed\&. If
\fIauto\fR
is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal, the ref names are shown as if
\fIshort\fR
were given, otherwise no ref names are shown\&. The option
\fB\-\-decorate\fR
is short\-hand for
\fB\-\-decorate=short\fR\&. Default to configuration value of
\fBlog\&.decorate\fR
if configured, otherwise,
\fBauto\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-decorate\-refs=<pattern>, \-\-decorate\-refs\-exclude=<pattern>
.RS 4
For each candidate reference, do not use it for decoration if it matches any patterns given to
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\-exclude\fR
or if it doesn\(cqt match any of the patterns given to
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\fR\&. The
\fBlog\&.excludeDecoration\fR
config option allows excluding refs from the decorations, but an explicit
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\fR
pattern will override a match in
\fBlog\&.excludeDecoration\fR\&.
.sp
If none of these options or config settings are given, then references are used as decoration if they match
\fBHEAD\fR,
\fBrefs/heads/\fR,
\fBrefs/remotes/\fR,
\fBrefs/stash/\fR, or
\fBrefs/tags/\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-clear\-decorations
.RS 4
When specified, this option clears all previous
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\fR
or
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\-exclude\fR
options and relaxes the default decoration filter to include all references\&. This option is assumed if the config value
\fBlog\&.initialDecorationSet\fR
is set to
\fBall\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-source
.RS 4
Print out the ref name given on the command line by which each commit was reached\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]mailmap, \-\-[no\-]use\-mailmap
.RS 4
Use mailmap file to map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical real names and email addresses\&. See
\fBgit-shortlog\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-diff
.RS 4
Without this flag,
\fBgit log \-p <path>\&.\&.\&.\fR
shows commits that touch the specified paths, and diffs about the same specified paths\&. With this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified paths; this means that "<path>\&..." limits only commits, and doesn\(cqt limit diff for those commits\&.
.sp
Note that this affects all diff\-based output types, e\&.g\&. those produced by
\fB\-\-stat\fR, etc\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-log\-size
.RS 4
Include a line \(lqlog size <number>\(rq in the output for each commit, where <number> is the length of that commit\(cqs message in bytes\&. Intended to speed up tools that read log messages from
\fBgit log\fR
output by allowing them to allocate space in advance\&.
.RE
.PP
\-L<start>,<end>:<file>, \-L:<funcname>:<file>
.RS 4
Trace the evolution of the line range given by
\fI<start>,<end>\fR, or by the function name regex
\fI<funcname>\fR, within the
\fI<file>\fR\&. You may not give any pathspec limiters\&. This is currently limited to a walk starting from a single revision, i\&.e\&., you may only give zero or one positive revision arguments, and
\fI<start>\fR
and
\fI<end>\fR
(or
\fI<funcname>\fR) must exist in the starting revision\&. You can specify this option more than once\&. Implies
\fB\-\-patch\fR\&. Patch output can be suppressed using
\fB\-\-no\-patch\fR, but other diff formats (namely
\fB\-\-raw\fR,
\fB\-\-numstat\fR,
\fB\-\-shortstat\fR,
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR,
\fB\-\-summary\fR,
\fB\-\-name\-only\fR,
\fB\-\-name\-status\fR,
\fB\-\-check\fR) are not currently implemented\&.
.sp
\fI<start>\fR
and
\fI<end>\fR
can take one of these forms:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
number
.sp
If
\fI<start>\fR
or
\fI<end>\fR
is a number, it specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1)\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fB/regex/\fR
.sp
This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex\&. If
\fI<start>\fR
is a regex, it will search from the end of the previous
\fB\-L\fR
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&. If
\fI<start>\fR
is
\fB^/regex/\fR, it will search from the start of file\&. If
\fI<end>\fR
is a regex, it will search starting at the line given by
\fI<start>\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
+offset or \-offset
.sp
This is only valid for
\fI<end>\fR
and will specify a number of lines before or after the line given by
\fI<start>\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
If
\fB:<funcname>\fR
is given in place of
\fI<start>\fR
and
\fI<end>\fR, it is a regular expression that denotes the range from the first funcname line that matches
\fI<funcname>\fR, up to the next funcname line\&.
\fB:<funcname>\fR
searches from the end of the previous
\fB\-L\fR
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&.
\fB^:<funcname>\fR
searches from the start of file\&. The function names are determined in the same way as
\fBgit diff\fR
works out patch hunk headers (see
\fIDefining a custom hunk\-header\fR
in
\fBgitattributes\fR(5))\&.
.RE
.PP
<revision\-range>
.RS 4
Show only commits in the specified revision range\&. When no <revision\-range> is specified, it defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR
(i\&.e\&. the whole history leading to the current commit)\&.
\fBorigin\&.\&.HEAD\fR
specifies all the commits reachable from the current commit (i\&.e\&.
\fBHEAD\fR), but not from
\fBorigin\fR\&. For a complete list of ways to spell <revision\-range>, see the
\fISpecifying Ranges\fR
section of
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.
.RE
.PP
[\-\-] <path>\&...
.RS 4
Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the specified paths came to be\&. See
\fIHistory Simplification\fR
below for details and other simplification modes\&.
.sp
Paths may need to be prefixed with
\fB\-\-\fR
to separate them from options or the revision range, when confusion arises\&.
.RE
.SS "Commit Limiting"
.sp
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may be applied\&.
.sp
Using more options generally further limits the output (e\&.g\&. \fB\-\-since=<date1>\fR limits to commits newer than \fB<date1>\fR, and using it with \fB\-\-grep=<pattern>\fR further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches \fB<pattern>\fR), unless otherwise noted\&.
.sp
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as \fB\-\-reverse\fR\&.
.PP
\-<number>, \-n <number>, \-\-max\-count=<number>
.RS 4
Limit the number of commits to output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-skip=<number>
.RS 4
Skip
\fInumber\fR
commits before starting to show the commit output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-since=<date>, \-\-after=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits more recent than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-since\-as\-filter=<date>
.RS 4
Show all commits more recent than a specific date\&. This visits all commits in the range, rather than stopping at the first commit which is older than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-until=<date>, \-\-before=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits older than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-author=<pattern>, \-\-committer=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-author=<pattern>\fR, commits whose author matches any of the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple
\fB\-\-committer=<pattern>\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep\-reflog=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-grep\-reflog\fR, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given patterns are chosen\&. It is an error to use this option unless
\fB\-\-walk\-reflogs\fR
is in use\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that matches the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-grep=<pattern>\fR, commits whose message matches any of the given patterns are chosen (but see
\fB\-\-all\-match\fR)\&.
.sp
When
\fB\-\-notes\fR
is in effect, the message from the notes is matched as if it were part of the log message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all\-match
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
\fB\-\-grep\fR, instead of ones that match at least one\&.
.RE

\fB\-\-no\-merges\fR,
\fB\-\-min\-parents=2\fR
is the same as
\fB\-\-merges\fR\&.
\fB\-\-max\-parents=0\fR

\fB\-\-min\-parents=3\fR
all octopus merges\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-min\-parents\fR
and
\fB\-\-no\-max\-parents\fR
reset these limits (to no limit) again\&. Equivalent forms are
\fB\-\-min\-parents=0\fR
(any commit has 0 or more parents) and
\fB\-\-max\-parents=\-1\fR
(negative numbers denote no upper limit)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-first\-parent
.RS 4
When finding commits to include, follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\&. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge\&.
.sp
This option also changes default diff format for merge commits to
\fBfirst\-parent\fR, see
\fB\-\-diff\-merges=first\-parent\fR
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exclude\-first\-parent\-only
.RS 4
When finding commits to exclude (with a

Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example the commits modifying a particular <path>\&. But there are two parts of \fIHistory Simplification\fR, one part is selecting the commits and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history\&.

.PP

This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them\&. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get

A regular

since
\fBD\fR, in the sense that \(lqwhat does

\fBB\fR

\fBD\fR

When we want to find out what commits in

are contaminated with the bug introduced by

\fID\&.\&.M\fR
that are actually descendants of
\fBD\fR, i\&.e\&. excluding
\fBC\fR

\fBK\fR\&. This is exactly what the

If we instead are interested in a given topic within this range, and all commits affected by that topic, we may only want to view the subset of

For this example, suppose \fBI\fR created \fBfile\&.txt\fR which was modified by \fBA\fR, \fBB\fR, and \fBX\fR in different ways\&. The single\-parent commits \fBC\fR, \fBZ\fR, and \fBY\fR do not change \fBfile\&.txt\fR\&. The merge commit \fBM\fR was created by resolving the merge conflict to include both changes from \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR and hence is not TREESAME to either\&. The merge commit \fBR\fR, however, was created by ignoring the contents of \fBfile\&.txt\fR at \fBM\fR and taking only the contents of \fBfile\&.txt\fR at \fBX\fR\&. Hence, \fBR\fR is TREESAME to \fBX\fR but not \fBM\fR\&. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create \fBN\fR is to take the contents of \fBfile\&.txt\fR at \fBR\fR, so \fBN\fR is TREESAME to \fBR\fR but not \fBC\fR\&. The merge commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR are TREESAME to their first parents, but not to their second parents, \fBZ\fR and \fBY\fR respectively\&.
.sp
When using the default mode, \fBN\fR and \fBR\fR both have a TREESAME parent, so those edges are walked and the others are ignored\&. The resulting history graph is:

When using \fB\-\-full\-history\fR, Git walks every edge\&. This will discover the commits \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR and the merge \fBM\fR, but also will reveal the merge commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR\&. With parent rewriting, the resulting graph is:

Here, the merge commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR contribute extra noise, as they did not actually contribute a change to \fBfile\&.txt\fR\&. They only merged a topic that was based on an older version of \fBfile\&.txt\fR\&. This is a common issue in repositories using a workflow where many contributors work in parallel and merge their topic branches along a single trunk: many unrelated merges appear in the \fB\-\-full\-history\fR results\&.
.sp
When using the \fB\-\-simplify\-merges\fR option, the commits \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR disappear from the results\&. This is because the rewritten second parents of \fBO\fR and \fBP\fR are reachable from their first parents\&. Those edges are removed and then the commits look like single\-parent commits that are TREESAME to their parent\&. This also happens to the commit \fBN\fR, resulting in a history view as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
          \&.\-A\-\-\-M\-\-\&.

In this view, we see all of the important single\-parent changes from \fBA\fR, \fBB\fR, and \fBX\fR\&. We also see the carefully\-resolved merge \fBM\fR and the not\-so\-carefully\-resolved merge \fBR\fR\&. This is usually enough information to determine why the commits \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR "disappeared" from history in the default view\&. However, there are a few issues with this approach\&.
.sp
The first issue is performance\&. Unlike any previous option, the \fB\-\-simplify\-merges\fR option requires walking the entire commit history before returning a single result\&. This can make the option difficult to use for very large repositories\&.
.sp
The second issue is one of auditing\&. When many contributors are working on the same repository, it is important which merge commits introduced a change into an important branch\&. The problematic merge \fBR\fR above is not likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an important branch\&. Instead, the merge \fBN\fR was used to merge \fBR\fR and \fBX\fR into the important branch\&. This commit may have information about why the change \fBX\fR came to override the changes from \fBA\fR and \fBB\fR in its commit message\&.

The \fB\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration\fR option allows you to view only the big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not referenced by tags\&. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words, kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given on the command line\&. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified away)\&.

Commit objects record the character encoding used for the log message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to re\-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user\&. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF\-8\&. Note that if an object claims to be encoded in

Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough spaces to fill to the next display column that is a multiple of

\fItformat:\fR
.sp
The
\fItformat:\fR
format works exactly like
\fIformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\&. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\&. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \e

.fi
.if n \{\

In addition, any unrecognized string that has a
\fB%\fR

\fBtformat:\fR
in front of it\&. For example, these two are equivalent:

.if n \{\

$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef

.sp
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
\fBm\fR

.sp
When used with \-M, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually \-M only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
\fBn\fR
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 50%)\&.

If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit\&. For following files across renames while traversing history, see

A \fB\-\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\&.

.RS 4
By default,
\fBgit log\fR
only shows decorations for certain known ref namespaces\&. If
\fIall\fR
is specified, then show all refs as decorations\&.
.RE
.PP
log\&.excludeDecoration
.RS 4
Exclude the specified patterns from the log decorations\&. This is similar to the
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\-exclude\fR
command\-line option, but the config option can be overridden by the
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
log\&.diffMerges
.RS 4
Set diff format to be used when
\fB\-\-diff\-merges=on\fR
is specified, see
\fB\-\-diff\-merges\fR
in
\fBgit-log\fR(1)
for details\&. Defaults to
\fBseparate\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
log\&.follow
.RS 4
If
\fBtrue\fR,
\fBgit log\fR
will act as if the
\fB\-\-follow\fR
option was used when a single <path> is given\&. This has the same limitations as
\fB\-\-follow\fR, i\&.e\&. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and does not work well on non\-linear history\&.
.RE
.PP
log\&.graphColors
.RS 4
A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used to draw history lines in
\fBgit log \-\-graph\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
log\&.showRoot
.RS 4
If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big creation event\&. This is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree\&. Tools like
\fBgit-log\fR(1)
or
\fBgit-whatchanged\fR(1), which normally hide the root commit will now show it\&. True by default\&.
.RE
.PP
log\&.showSignature
.RS 4
If true, makes
\fBgit-log\fR(1),
\fBgit-show\fR(1), and
\fBgit-whatchanged\fR(1)
assume
\fB\-\-show\-signature\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
log\&.mailmap
.RS 4
If true, makes
\fBgit-log\fR(1),
\fBgit-show\fR(1), and
\fBgit-whatchanged\fR(1)
assume
\fB\-\-use\-mailmap\fR, otherwise assume
\fB\-\-no\-use\-mailmap\fR\&. True by default\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.mergeStrategy
.RS 4
Which merge strategy to choose by default when resolving notes conflicts\&. Must be one of
\fBmanual\fR,
\fBours\fR,
\fBtheirs\fR,
\fBunion\fR, or
\fBcat_sort_uniq\fR\&. Defaults to
\fBmanual\fR\&. See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section of
\fBgit-notes\fR(1)
for more information on each strategy\&.
.sp
This setting can be overridden by passing the
\fB\-\-strategy\fR
option to
\fBgit-notes\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.<name>\&.mergeStrategy
.RS 4
Which merge strategy to choose when doing a notes merge into refs/notes/<name>\&. This overrides the more general "notes\&.mergeStrategy"\&. See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section in
\fBgit-notes\fR(1)
for more information on the available strategies\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.displayRef
.RS 4
Which ref (or refs, if a glob or specified more than once), in addition to the default set by
\fBcore\&.notesRef\fR
or
\fBGIT_NOTES_REF\fR, to read notes from when showing commit messages with the
\fIgit log\fR
family of commands\&.
.sp
This setting can be overridden with the
\fBGIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF\fR
environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs or globs\&.
.sp
A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that does not match any refs is silently ignored\&.
.sp
This setting can be disabled by the
\fB\-\-no\-notes\fR
option to the
\fIgit log\fR
family of commands, or by the
\fB\-\-notes=<ref>\fR
option accepted by those commands\&.
.sp
The effective value of "core\&.notesRef" (possibly overridden by GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly added to the list of refs to be displayed\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.rewrite\&.<command>
.RS 4
When rewriting commits with <command> (currently
\fBamend\fR
or
\fBrebase\fR), if this variable is
\fBfalse\fR, git will not copy notes from the original to the rewritten commit\&. Defaults to
\fBtrue\fR\&. See also "\fBnotes\&.rewriteRef\fR" below\&.
.sp
This setting can be overridden with the
\fBGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF\fR
environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs or globs\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.rewriteMode
.RS 4
When copying notes during a rewrite (see the "notes\&.rewrite\&.<command>" option), determines what to do if the target commit already has a note\&. Must be one of
\fBoverwrite\fR,
\fBconcatenate\fR,
\fBcat_sort_uniq\fR, or
\fBignore\fR\&. Defaults to
\fBconcatenate\fR\&.
.sp
This setting can be overridden with the
\fBGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE\fR
environment variable\&.
.RE
.PP
notes\&.rewriteRef
.RS 4
When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully qualified) ref whose notes should be copied\&. May be a glob, in which case notes in all matching refs will be copied\&. You may also specify this configuration several times\&.
.sp
Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to enable note rewriting\&. Set it to
\fBrefs/notes/commits\fR
to enable rewriting for the default commit notes\&.
.sp
Can be overridden with the
\fBGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF\fR
environment variable\&. See
\fBnotes\&.rewrite\&.<command>\fR
above for a further description of its format\&.
