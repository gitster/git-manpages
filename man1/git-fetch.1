.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories\&. Remote\-tracking branches are updated (see the description of \fI<refspec>\fR below for ways to control this behavior)\&.
.sp
By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that you are interested in\&. This default behavior can be changed by using the \fB\-\-tags\fR or \fB\-\-no\-tags\fR options or by configuring \fBremote\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.tagOpt\fR\&. By using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly, you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested in as well\&.
.sp
\fBgit\fR \fBfetch\fR can fetch from either a single named repository or URL, or from several repositories at once if \fI<group>\fR is given and there is a \fBremotes\&.\fR\fI<group>\fR entry in the configuration file\&. (See \fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.sp
When no remote is specified, by default the \fBorigin\fR remote will be used, unless there\(cqs an upstream branch configured for the current branch\&.
.sp
The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object names they point at, are written to \&.\fBgit/FETCH_HEAD\fR\&. This information may be used by scripts or other git commands, such as \fBgit-pull\fR(1)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-all\fR, \fB\-\-no\-all\fR
.RS 4
Fetch all remotes, except for the ones that has the
\fBremote\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.skipFetchAll\fR
configuration variable set\&. This overrides the configuration variable
\fBfetch\&.all\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-append\fR
.RS 4
Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing contents of \&.\fBgit/FETCH_HEAD\fR\&. Without this option old data in \&.\fBgit/FETCH_HEAD\fR
will be overwritten\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-atomic\fR
.RS 4
Use an atomic transaction to update local refs\&. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-depth=\fR\fI<depth>\fR
.RS 4
Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of each remote branch history\&. If fetching to a
\fIshallow\fR
repository created by
\fBgit\fR
\fBclone\fR
with
\fB\-\-depth=\fR\fI<depth>\fR
option (see
\fBgit-clone\fR(1)), deepen or shorten the history to the specified number of commits\&. Tags for the deepened commits are not fetched\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-deepen=\fR\fI<depth>\fR
.RS 4
Similar to
\fB\-\-depth\fR, except it specifies the number of commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each remote branch history\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-shallow\-since=\fR\fI<date>\fR
.RS 4
Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to include all reachable commits after
\fI<date>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-shallow\-exclude=\fR\fI<ref>\fR
.RS 4
Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag\&. This option can be specified multiple times\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-unshallow\fR
.RS 4
If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow repositories\&.
.sp
If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so that the current repository has the same history as the source repository\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-update\-shallow\fR
.RS 4
By default when fetching from a shallow repository,
\fBgit\fR
\fBfetch\fR
refuses refs that require updating \&.\fBgit/shallow\fR\&. This option updates \&.\fBgit/shallow\fR
and accepts such refs\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-negotiation\-tip=\fR(\fI<commit>\fR|\fI<glob>\fR)
.RS 4
By default, Git will report, to the server, commits reachable from all local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce the size of the to\-be\-received packfile\&. If specified, Git will only report commits reachable from the given tips\&. This is useful to speed up fetches when the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with the upstream ref being fetched\&.
.sp
This option may be specified more than once; if so, Git will report commits reachable from any of the given commits\&.
.sp
The argument to this option may be a glob on ref names, a ref, or the (possibly abbreviated) SHA\-1 of a commit\&. Specifying a glob is equivalent to specifying this option multiple times, one for each matching ref name\&.
.sp
See also the
\fBfetch\&.negotiationAlgorithm\fR
and
\fBpush\&.negotiate\fR
configuration variables documented in
\fBgit-config\fR(1), and the
\fB\-\-negotiate\-only\fR
option below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-negotiate\-only\fR
.RS 4
Do not fetch anything from the server, and instead print the ancestors of the provided
\fB\-\-negotiation\-tip=\fR
arguments, which we have in common with the server\&.
.sp
This is incompatible with
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules=\fR(\fByes\fR|\fBon\-demand\fR)\&. Internally this is used to implement the
\fBpush\&.negotiate\fR
option, see
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
.RS 4
Show what would be done, without making any changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-porcelain\fR
.RS 4
Print the output to standard output in an easy\-to\-parse format for scripts\&. See section OUTPUT in
\fBgit-fetch\fR(1)
for details\&.
.sp
This is incompatible with
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules=\fR(\fByes\fR|\fBon\-demand\fR) and takes precedence over the
\fBfetch\&.output\fR
config option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-write\-fetch\-head\fR, \fB\-\-no\-write\-fetch\-head\fR
.RS 4
Write the list of remote refs fetched in the
\fBFETCH_HEAD\fR
file directly under
\fB$GIT_DIR\fR\&. This is the default\&. Passing
\fB\-\-no\-write\-fetch\-head\fR
from the command line tells Git not to write the file\&. Under
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
option, the file is never written\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
.RS 4
When
\fBgit\fR
\fBfetch\fR
is used with
\fI<src>\fR\fB:\fR\fI<dst>\fR
refspec, it may refuse to update the local branch as discussed in the
\fI<refspec>\fR
part below\&. This option overrides that check\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keep\fR
.RS 4
Keep downloaded pack\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-multiple\fR
.RS 4
Allow several
\fI<repository>\fR
and
\fI<group>\fR
arguments to be specified\&. No
\fI<refspec>\fRs may be specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-auto\-maintenance\fR, \fB\-\-no\-auto\-maintenance\fR, \fB\-\-auto\-gc\fR, \fB\-\-no\-auto\-gc\fR
.RS 4
Run
\fBgit\fR
\fBmaintenance\fR
\fBrun\fR
\fB\-\-auto\fR
at the end to perform automatic repository maintenance if needed\&. This is enabled by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-write\-commit\-graph\fR, \fB\-\-no\-write\-commit\-graph\fR
.RS 4
Write a commit\-graph after fetching\&. This overrides the config setting
\fBfetch\&.writeCommitGraph\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-prefetch\fR
.RS 4
Modify the configured refspec to place all refs into the
\fBrefs/prefetch/\fR
namespace\&. See the
\fBprefetch\fR
task in
\fBgit-maintenance\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-prune\fR
.RS 4
Before fetching, remove any remote\-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote\&. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are fetched only because of the default tag auto\-following or due to a
\fB\-\-tags\fR
option\&. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either on the command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote was cloned with the
\fB\-\-mirror\fR
option), then they are also subject to pruning\&. Supplying
\fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR
is a shorthand for providing the tag refspec\&.
.sp
See the PRUNING section below for more details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR
.RS 4
Before fetching, remove any local tags that no longer exist on the remote if
\fB\-\-prune\fR
is enabled\&. This option should be used more carefully, unlike
\fB\-\-prune\fR
it will remove any local references (local tags) that have been created\&. This option is a shorthand for providing the explicit tag refspec along with
\fB\-\-prune\fR, see the discussion about that in its documentation\&.
.sp
See the PRUNING section below for more details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-tags\fR
.RS 4
By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally\&. This option disables this automatic tag following\&. The default behavior for a remote may be specified with the
\fBremote\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.tagOpt\fR
setting\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-refetch\fR
.RS 4
Instead of negotiating with the server to avoid transferring commits and associated objects that are already present locally, this option fetches all objects as a fresh clone would\&. Use this to reapply a partial clone filter from configuration or using
\fB\-\-filter=\fR
when the filter definition has changed\&. Automatic post\-fetch maintenance will perform object database pack consolidation to remove any duplicate objects\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-refmap=\fR\fI<refspec>\fR
.RS 4
When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the specified refspec (can be given more than once) to map the refs to remote\-tracking branches, instead of the values of
\fBremote\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.fetch\fR
configuration variables for the remote repository\&. Providing an empty
\fI<refspec>\fR
to the
\fB\-\-refmap\fR
option causes Git to ignore the configured refspecs and rely entirely on the refspecs supplied as command\-line arguments\&. See section on "Configured Remote\-tracking Branches" for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tags\fR
.RS 4
Fetch all tags from the remote (i\&.e\&., fetch remote tags
\fBrefs/tags/*\fR
into local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else would otherwise be fetched\&. Using this option alone does not subject tags to pruning, even if
\fB\-\-prune\fR
is used (though tags may be pruned anyway if they are also the destination of an explicit refspec; see
\fB\-\-prune\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules\fR[\fB=\fR(\fByes\fR|\fBon\-demand\fR|\fBno\fR)]
.RS 4
Control if and under what conditions new commits of submodules should be fetched too\&. When recursing through submodules,
\fBgit\fR
\fBfetch\fR
always attempts to fetch "changed" submodules, that is, a submodule that has commits that are referenced by a newly fetched superproject commit but are missing in the local submodule clone\&. A changed submodule can be fetched as long as it is present locally e\&.g\&. in
\fB$GIT_DIR/modules/\fR
(see
\fBgitsubmodules\fR(7)); if the upstream adds a new submodule, that submodule cannot be fetched until it is cloned e\&.g\&. by
\fBgit\fR
\fBsubmodule\fR
\fBupdate\fR\&.
.sp
When set to
\fBon\-demand\fR, only changed submodules are fetched\&. When set to
\fByes\fR, all populated submodules are fetched and submodules that are both unpopulated and changed are fetched\&. When set to
\fBno\fR, submodules are never fetched\&.
.sp
When unspecified, this uses the value of
\fBfetch\&.recurseSubmodules\fR
if it is set (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1)), defaulting to
\fBon\-demand\fR
if unset\&. When this option is used without any value, it defaults to
\fByes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-j\fR \fI<n>\fR, \fB\-\-jobs=\fR\fI<n>\fR
.RS 4
Parallelize all forms of fetching up to
\fI<n>\fR
jobs at a time\&.
.sp
If the
\fB\-\-multiple\fR
option was specified, the different remotes will be fetched in parallel\&. If multiple submodules are fetched, they will be fetched in parallel\&. To control them independently, use the config settings
\fBfetch\&.parallel\fR
and
\fBsubmodule\&.fetchJobs\fR
(see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.sp
Typically, parallel recursive and multi\-remote fetches will be faster\&. By default fetches are performed sequentially, not in parallel\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-recurse\-submodules\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules\-default=\fR(\fByes\fR|\fBon\-demand\fR)
.RS 4
This option is used internally to temporarily provide a non\-negative default value for the
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules\fR
option\&. All other methods of configuring fetch\(cqs submodule recursion (such as settings in
\fBgitmodules\fR(5)
and
\fBgit-config\fR(1)) override this option, as does specifying
\fB\-\-\fR[\fBno\-\fR]\fBrecurse\-submodules\fR
directly\&.

\fB\-\-server\-option=\fR\fI<option>\fR
are given, they are all sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line\&. When no
\fB\-\-server\-option=\fR\fI<option>\fR

\fB\-\-show\-forced\-updates\fR
.RS 4
By default, git checks if a branch is force\-updated during fetch\&. This can be disabled through

\fBfetch\&.showForcedUpdates\fR
to false to skip this check for performance reasons\&. If used during
\fBgit\-pull\fR

\fI<repository>\fR
.RS 4
The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch or pull operation\&. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section
GIT URLS
below) or the name of a remote (see the section
REMOTES
below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI<group>\fR
.RS 4
A name referring to a list of repositories as the value of
\fBremotes\&.\fR\fI<group>\fR
in the configuration file\&. (See
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI<refspec>\fR
.RS 4
Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update\&. When no
\fI<refspec>\fRs appear on the command line, the refs to fetch are read from
\fBremote\&.\fR\fI<repository>\fR\fB\&.fetch\fR
variables instead (see
CONFIGURED REMOTE\-TRACKING BRANCHES
below)\&.
.sp
The format of a
\fI<refspec>\fR
parameter is an optional plus
\fB+\fR, followed by the source
\fI<src>\fR, followed by a colon
\fB:\fR, followed by the destination
\fI<dst>\fR\&. The colon can be omitted when
\fI<dst>\fR
is empty\&.
\fI<src>\fR
is typically a ref, or a glob pattern with a single
\fB*\fR
that is used to match a set of refs, but it can also be a fully spelled hex object name\&.
.sp
A
\fI<refspec>\fR
may contain a
\fB*\fR
in its
\fI<src>\fR
to indicate a simple pattern match\&. Such a refspec functions like a glob that matches any ref with the pattern\&. A pattern
\fI<refspec>\fR
must have one and only one
\fB*\fR
in both the
\fI<src>\fR
and
\fI<dst>\fR\&. It will map refs to the destination by replacing the
\fB*\fR
with the contents matched from the source\&.
.sp
If a refspec is prefixed by
\fB^\fR, it will be interpreted as a negative refspec\&. Rather than specifying which refs to fetch or which local refs to update, such a refspec will instead specify refs to exclude\&. A ref will be considered to match if it matches at least one positive refspec, and does not match any negative refspec\&. Negative refspecs can be useful to restrict the scope of a pattern refspec so that it will not include specific refs\&. Negative refspecs can themselves be pattern refspecs\&. However, they may only contain a
\fI<src>\fR
and do not specify a
\fI<dst>\fR\&. Fully spelled out hex object names are also not supported\&.
.sp
\fBtag\fR
\fI<tag>\fR
means the same as
\fBrefs/tags/\fR\fI<tag>\fR\fB:refs/tags/\fR\fI<tag>\fR; it requests fetching everything up to the given tag\&.
.sp
The remote ref that matches
\fI<src>\fR
is fetched, and if
\fI<dst>\fR
is not an empty string, an attempt is made to update the local ref that matches it\&.
.sp
Whether that update is allowed without
\fB\-\-force\fR
depends on the ref namespace it\(cqs being fetched to, the type of object being fetched, and whether the update is considered to be a fast\-forward\&. Generally, the same rules apply for fetching as when pushing, see the
\fI<refspec>\fR\&.\&.\&. section of
\fBgit-push\fR(1)
for what those are\&. Exceptions to those rules particular to
\fBgit\fR
\fBfetch\fR
are noted below\&.
.sp
Until Git version 2\&.20, and unlike when pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), any updates to
\fBrefs/tags/*\fR
would be accepted without
\fB+\fR
in the refspec (or
\fB\-\-force\fR)\&. When fetching, we promiscuously considered all tag updates from a remote to be forced fetches\&. Since Git version 2\&.20, fetching to update
\fBrefs/tags/*\fR
works the same way as when pushing\&. I\&.e\&. any updates will be rejected without
\fB+\fR
in the refspec (or
\fB\-\-force\fR)\&.
.sp
Unlike when pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), any updates outside of
\fBrefs/\fR{tags,heads}/* will be accepted without
\fB+\fR
in the refspec (or
\fB\-\-force\fR), whether that\(cqs swapping e\&.g\&. a tree object for a blob, or a commit for another commit that doesn\(cqt have the previous commit as an ancestor etc\&.
.sp
Unlike when pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), there is no configuration which\(cqll amend these rules, and nothing like a
\fBpre\-fetch\fR
hook analogous to the
\fBpre\-receive\fR
hook\&.
.sp
As with pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), all of the rules described above about what\(cqs not allowed as an update can be overridden by adding an optional leading
\fB+\fR
to a refspec (or using the
\fB\-\-force\fR
command line option)\&. The only exception to this is that no amount of forcing will make the
\fBrefs/heads/*\fR
namespace accept a non\-commit object\&.

When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to be rewound and rebased regularly, it is expected that its new tip will not be a descendant of its previous tip (as stored in your remote\-tracking branch the last time you fetched)\&. You would want to use the
\fB+\fR
sign to indicate non\-fast\-forward updates will be needed for such branches\&. There is no way to determine or declare that a branch will be made available in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch\&.

.SH "PRUNING"
.sp
Git has a default disposition of keeping data unless it\(cqs explicitly thrown away; this extends to holding onto local references to branches on remotes that have themselves deleted those branches\&.
.sp
If left to accumulate, these stale references might make performance worse on big and busy repos that have a lot of branch churn, and e\&.g\&. make the output of commands like \fBgit\fR \fBbranch\fR \fB\-a\fR \fB\-\-contains\fR \fI<commit>\fR needlessly verbose, as well as impacting anything else that\(cqll work with the complete set of known references\&.
.sp
These remote\-tracking references can be deleted as a one\-off with either of:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# While fetching
$ git fetch \-\-prune <name>

# Only prune, don\*(Aqt fetch
$ git remote prune <name>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To prune references as part of your normal workflow without needing to remember to run that, set \fBfetch\&.prune\fR globally, or \fBremote\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.prune\fR per\-remote in the config\&. See \fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.sp
Here\(cqs where things get tricky and more specific\&. The pruning feature doesn\(cqt actually care about branches, instead it\(cqll prune local \(<-\(-> remote\-references as a function of the refspec of the remote (see \fI<refspec>\fR and CONFIGURED REMOTE\-TRACKING BRANCHES above)\&.
.sp
Therefore if the refspec for the remote includes e\&.g\&. \fBrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\fR, or you manually run e\&.g\&. \fBgit\fR \fBfetch\fR \fB\-\-prune\fR \fI<name>\fR "refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*" it won\(cqt be stale remote tracking branches that are deleted, but any local tag that doesn\(cqt exist on the remote\&.
.sp
This might not be what you expect, i\&.e\&. you want to prune remote \fI<name>\fR, but also explicitly fetch tags from it, so when you fetch from it you delete all your local tags, most of which may not have come from the \fI<name>\fR remote in the first place\&.
.sp
So be careful when using this with a refspec like \fBrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\fR, or any other refspec which might map references from multiple remotes to the same local namespace\&.
.sp
Since keeping up\-to\-date with both branches and tags on the remote is a common use\-case the \fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR option can be supplied along with \fB\-\-prune\fR to prune local tags that don\(cqt exist on the remote, and force\-update those tags that differ\&. Tag pruning can also be enabled with \fBfetch\&.pruneTags\fR or \fBremote\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.pruneTags\fR in the config\&. See \fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.sp
The \fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR option is equivalent to having \fBrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\fR declared in the refspecs of the remote\&. This can lead to some seemingly strange interactions:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# These both fetch tags
$ git fetch \-\-no\-tags origin \*(Aqrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\*(Aq
$ git fetch \-\-no\-tags \-\-prune\-tags origin
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The reason it doesn\(cqt error out when provided without \fB\-\-prune\fR or its config versions is for flexibility of the configured versions, and to maintain a 1=1 mapping between what the command line flags do, and what the configuration versions do\&.
.sp
It\(cqs reasonable to e\&.g\&. configure \fBfetch\&.pruneTags=true\fR in \fB~/\&.gitconfig\fR to have tags pruned whenever \fBgit\fR \fBfetch\fR \fB\-\-prune\fR is run, without making every invocation of \fBgit\fR \fBfetch\fR without \fB\-\-prune\fR an error\&.
.sp
Pruning tags with \fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR also works when fetching a URL instead of a named remote\&. These will all prune tags not found on origin:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git fetch origin \-\-prune \-\-prune\-tags
$ git fetch origin \-\-prune \*(Aqrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\*(Aq

.RE
.SH "SECURITY"
.sp
The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be shared\&. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious peer, your best option is to store it in another repository\&. This applies to both clients and servers\&. In particular, namespaces on a server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire repository\&.
.sp
The known attack vectors are as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them\&. The attacker chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn\(cqt required to send the content of X because the victim already has it\&. Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the attacker later\&. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has access to and then fetching it\&. The most likely way for a server to perform it on a client is to "merge" X into a public branch and hope that the user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server without noticing the merge\&.)

.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal\&. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X\&. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker\&.

Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the \fBgit-config\fR(1) documentation\&. The content is the same as what\(cqs found there:
.PP
\fBfetch\&.recurseSubmodules\fR
.RS 4
This option controls whether
\fBgit\fR
\fBfetch\fR
(and the underlying fetch in
\fBgit\fR
\fBpull\fR) will recursively fetch into populated submodules\&. This option can be set either to a boolean value or to
\fBon\-demand\fR\&. Setting it to a boolean changes the behavior of fetch and pull to recurse unconditionally into submodules when set to true or to not recurse at all when set to false\&. When set to
\fBon\-demand\fR, fetch and pull will only recurse into a populated submodule when its superproject retrieves a commit that updates the submodule\(cqs reference\&. Defaults to
\fBon\-demand\fR, or to the value of
\fBsubmodule\&.recurse\fR
if set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.fsckObjects\fR
.RS 4
If it is set to true, git\-fetch\-pack will check all fetched objects\&. See
\fBtransfer\&.fsckObjects\fR
for what\(cqs checked\&. Defaults to
\fBfalse\fR\&. If not set, the value of
\fBtransfer\&.fsckObjects\fR
is used instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.fsck\&.\fR\fI<msg\-id>\fR
.RS 4
Acts like
\fBfsck\&.\fR\fI<msg\-id>\fR, but is used by

\fBgit-fsck\fR(1)\&. See the
\fBfsck\&.skipList\fR
documentation for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.unpackLimit\fR
.RS 4
If the number of objects fetched over the Git native transfer is below this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose object files\&. However if the number of received objects equals or exceeds this limit then the received pack will be stored as a pack, after adding any missing delta bases\&. Storing the pack from a push can make the push operation complete faster, especially on slow filesystems\&. If not set, the value of
\fBtransfer\&.unpackLimit\fR
is used instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.prune\fR
.RS 4
If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the
\fB\-\-prune\fR
option was given on the command line\&. See also
\fBremote\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.prune\fR
and the PRUNING section of
\fBgit-fetch\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.pruneTags\fR
.RS 4
If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the
\fBrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\fR
refspec was provided when pruning, if not set already\&. This allows for setting both this option and
\fBfetch\&.prune\fR
to maintain a 1=1 mapping to upstream refs\&. See also
\fBremote\&.\fR\fI<name>\fR\fB\&.pruneTags\fR
and the PRUNING section of
\fBgit-fetch\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.all\fR
.RS 4
If true, fetch will attempt to update all available remotes\&. This behavior can be overridden by passing
\fB\-\-no\-all\fR
or by explicitly specifying one or more remote(s) to fetch from\&. Defaults to
\fBfalse\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.output\fR
.RS 4
Control how ref update status is printed\&. Valid values are
\fBfull\fR

\fBcompact\fR\&. Default value is
\fBfull\fR\&. See the OUTPUT section in
\fBgit-fetch\fR(1)

.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.negotiationAlgorithm\fR
.RS 4
Control how information about the commits in the local repository is sent when negotiating the contents of the packfile to be sent by the server\&. Set to
\fBconsecutive\fR
to use an algorithm that walks over consecutive commits checking each one\&. Set to
\fBskipping\fR
to use an algorithm that skips commits in an effort to converge faster, but may result in a larger\-than\-necessary packfile; or set to
\fBnoop\fR
to not send any information at all, which will almost certainly result in a larger\-than\-necessary packfile, but will skip the negotiation step\&. Set to
\fBdefault\fR
to override settings made previously and use the default behaviour\&. The default is normally
\fBconsecutive\fR, but if
\fBfeature\&.experimental\fR
is
\fBtrue\fR, then the default is
\fBskipping\fR\&. Unknown values will cause
\fBgit\fR
\fBfetch\fR
to error out\&.

\fBfetch\&.parallel\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the maximal number of fetch operations to be run in parallel at a time (submodules, or remotes when the
\fB\-\-multiple\fR
option of
\fBgit-fetch\fR(1)
is in effect)\&.
.sp
A value of 0 will give some reasonable default\&. If unset, it defaults to 1\&.

For submodules, this setting can be overridden using the
\fBsubmodule\&.fetchJobs\fR

.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.writeCommitGraph\fR
.RS 4
Set to true to write a commit\-graph after every
\fBgit\fR
\fBfetch\fR
command that downloads a pack\-file from a remote\&. Using the
\fB\-\-split\fR
option, most executions will create a very small commit\-graph file on top of the existing commit\-graph file(s)\&. Occasionally, these files will merge and the write may take longer\&. Having an updated commit\-graph file helps performance of many Git commands, including
\fBgit\fR
\fBmerge\-base\fR,
\fBgit\fR
\fBpush\fR
\fB\-f\fR, and
\fBgit\fR
\fBlog\fR
\fB\-\-graph\fR\&. Defaults to
\fBfalse\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.bundleURI\fR
.RS 4
This value stores a URI for downloading Git object data from a bundle URI before performing an incremental fetch from the origin Git server\&. This is similar to how the
\fB\-\-bundle\-uri\fR
option behaves in
\fBgit-clone\fR(1)\&.
\fBgit\fR
\fBclone\fR
\fB\-\-bundle\-uri\fR
will set the
\fBfetch\&.bundleURI\fR
value if the supplied bundle URI contains a bundle list that is organized for incremental fetches\&.
.sp
If you modify this value and your repository has a
\fBfetch\&.bundleCreationToken\fR
value, then remove that
\fBfetch\&.bundleCreationToken\fR
value before fetching from the new bundle URI\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfetch\&.bundleCreationToken\fR
.RS 4
When using
\fBfetch\&.bundleURI\fR
to fetch incrementally from a bundle list that uses the "\fBcreationToken\fR" heuristic, this config value stores the maximum
\fBcreationToken\fR
value of the downloaded bundles\&. This value is used to prevent downloading bundles in the future if the advertised
\fBcreationToken\fR
is not strictly larger than this value\&.
.sp
The creation token values are chosen by the provider serving the specific bundle URI\&. If you modify the URI at
\fBfetch\&.bundleURI\fR, then be sure to remove the value for the
\fBfetch\&.bundleCreationToken\fR
value before fetching\&.
.RE
.SH "BUGS"

Using \fB\-\-recurse\-submodules\fR can only fetch new commits in submodules that are present locally e\&.g\&. in \fB$GIT_DIR/modules/\fR\&.
