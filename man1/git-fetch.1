.SH "NAME"
git-fetch \- Download objects and refs from another repository
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit fetch\fR [<options>] [<repository> [<refspec>\&...]]
\fIgit fetch\fR [<options>] <group>
\fIgit fetch\fR \-\-multiple [<options>] [(<repository> | <group>)\&...]
\fIgit fetch\fR \-\-all [<options>]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories\&. Remote\-tracking branches are updated (see the description of <refspec> below for ways to control this behavior)\&.
.sp
By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that you are interested in\&. This default behavior can be changed by using the \-\-tags or \-\-no\-tags options or by configuring remote\&.<name>\&.tagOpt\&. By using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly, you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested in as well\&.
.sp
\fIgit fetch\fR can fetch from either a single named repository or URL, or from several repositories at once if <group> is given and there is a remotes\&.<group> entry in the configuration file\&. (See \fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.sp
When no remote is specified, by default the \fBorigin\fR remote will be used, unless there\(cqs an upstream branch configured for the current branch\&.
.sp
The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object names they point at, are written to \fB\&.git/FETCH_HEAD\fR\&. This information may be used by scripts or other git commands, such as \fBgit-pull\fR(1)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-[no\-]all
.RS 4
Fetch all remotes\&. This overrides the configuration variable
\fBfetch\&.all\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-a, \-\-append
.RS 4
Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing contents of
\fB\&.git/FETCH_HEAD\fR\&. Without this option old data in
\fB\&.git/FETCH_HEAD\fR
will be overwritten\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-atomic
.RS 4
Use an atomic transaction to update local refs\&. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-depth=<depth>
.RS 4
Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of each remote branch history\&. If fetching to a
\fIshallow\fR
repository created by
\fBgit clone\fR
with
\fB\-\-depth=<depth>\fR
option (see
\fBgit-clone\fR(1)), deepen or shorten the history to the specified number of commits\&. Tags for the deepened commits are not fetched\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-deepen=<depth>
.RS 4
Similar to \-\-depth, except it specifies the number of commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each remote branch history\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-shallow\-since=<date>
.RS 4
Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to include all reachable commits after <date>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-shallow\-exclude=<revision>
.RS 4
Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag\&. This option can be specified multiple times\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-unshallow
.RS 4
If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow repositories\&.
.sp
If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so that the current repository has the same history as the source repository\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-update\-shallow
.RS 4
By default when fetching from a shallow repository,
\fBgit fetch\fR
refuses refs that require updating \&.git/shallow\&. This option updates \&.git/shallow and accepts such refs\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-negotiation\-tip=<commit|glob>
.RS 4
By default, Git will report, to the server, commits reachable from all local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce the size of the to\-be\-received packfile\&. If specified, Git will only report commits reachable from the given tips\&. This is useful to speed up fetches when the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with the upstream ref being fetched\&.
.sp
This option may be specified more than once; if so, Git will report commits reachable from any of the given commits\&.
.sp
The argument to this option may be a glob on ref names, a ref, or the (possibly abbreviated) SHA\-1 of a commit\&. Specifying a glob is equivalent to specifying this option multiple times, one for each matching ref name\&.
.sp
See also the
\fBfetch\&.negotiationAlgorithm\fR
and
\fBpush\&.negotiate\fR
configuration variables documented in
\fBgit-config\fR(1), and the
\fB\-\-negotiate\-only\fR
option below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-negotiate\-only
.RS 4
Do not fetch anything from the server, and instead print the ancestors of the provided
\fB\-\-negotiation\-tip=*\fR
arguments, which we have in common with the server\&.
.sp
This is incompatible with
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules=[yes|on\-demand]\fR\&. Internally this is used to implement the
\fBpush\&.negotiate\fR
option, see
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dry\-run
.RS 4
Show what would be done, without making any changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-porcelain
.RS 4
Print the output to standard output in an easy\-to\-parse format for scripts\&. See section OUTPUT in
\fBgit-fetch\fR(1)
for details\&.
.sp
This is incompatible with
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules=[yes|on\-demand]\fR
and takes precedence over the
\fBfetch\&.output\fR
config option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]write\-fetch\-head
.RS 4
Write the list of remote refs fetched in the
\fBFETCH_HEAD\fR
file directly under
\fB$GIT_DIR\fR\&. This is the default\&. Passing
\fB\-\-no\-write\-fetch\-head\fR
from the command line tells Git not to write the file\&. Under
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
option, the file is never written\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f, \-\-force
.RS 4
When
\fIgit fetch\fR
is used with
\fB<src>:<dst>\fR
refspec, it may refuse to update the local branch as discussed in the
\fB<refspec>\fR
part below\&. This option overrides that check\&.
.RE
.PP
\-k, \-\-keep
.RS 4
Keep downloaded pack\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-multiple
.RS 4
Allow several <repository> and <group> arguments to be specified\&. No <refspec>s may be specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]auto\-maintenance, \-\-[no\-]auto\-gc
.RS 4
Run
\fBgit maintenance run \-\-auto\fR
at the end to perform automatic repository maintenance if needed\&. (\fB\-\-[no\-]auto\-gc\fR
is a synonym\&.) This is enabled by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]write\-commit\-graph
.RS 4
Write a commit\-graph after fetching\&. This overrides the config setting
\fBfetch\&.writeCommitGraph\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-prefetch
.RS 4
Modify the configured refspec to place all refs into the
\fBrefs/prefetch/\fR
namespace\&. See the
\fBprefetch\fR
task in
\fBgit-maintenance\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-prune
.RS 4
Before fetching, remove any remote\-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote\&. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are fetched only because of the default tag auto\-following or due to a \-\-tags option\&. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either on the command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote was cloned with the \-\-mirror option), then they are also subject to pruning\&. Supplying
\fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR
is a shorthand for providing the tag refspec\&.
.sp
See the PRUNING section below for more details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-P, \-\-prune\-tags
.RS 4
Before fetching, remove any local tags that no longer exist on the remote if
\fB\-\-prune\fR
is enabled\&. This option should be used more carefully, unlike
\fB\-\-prune\fR
it will remove any local references (local tags) that have been created\&. This option is a shorthand for providing the explicit tag refspec along with
\fB\-\-prune\fR, see the discussion about that in its documentation\&.
.sp
See the PRUNING section below for more details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-no\-tags
.RS 4
By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally\&. This option disables this automatic tag following\&. The default behavior for a remote may be specified with the remote\&.<name>\&.tagOpt setting\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-refetch
.RS 4
Instead of negotiating with the server to avoid transferring commits and associated objects that are already present locally, this option fetches all objects as a fresh clone would\&. Use this to reapply a partial clone filter from configuration or using
\fB\-\-filter=\fR
when the filter definition has changed\&. Automatic post\-fetch maintenance will perform object database pack consolidation to remove any duplicate objects\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-refmap=<refspec>
.RS 4
When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the specified refspec (can be given more than once) to map the refs to remote\-tracking branches, instead of the values of
\fBremote\&.*\&.fetch\fR
configuration variables for the remote repository\&. Providing an empty
\fB<refspec>\fR
to the
\fB\-\-refmap\fR
option causes Git to ignore the configured refspecs and rely entirely on the refspecs supplied as command\-line arguments\&. See section on "Configured Remote\-tracking Branches" for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t, \-\-tags
.RS 4
Fetch all tags from the remote (i\&.e\&., fetch remote tags
\fBrefs/tags/*\fR
into local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else would otherwise be fetched\&. Using this option alone does not subject tags to pruning, even if \-\-prune is used (though tags may be pruned anyway if they are also the destination of an explicit refspec; see
\fB\-\-prune\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-recurse\-submodules[=(yes|on\-demand|no)]
.RS 4
This option controls if and under what conditions new commits of submodules should be fetched too\&. When recursing through submodules,
\fBgit fetch\fR
always attempts to fetch "changed" submodules, that is, a submodule that has commits that are referenced by a newly fetched superproject commit but are missing in the local submodule clone\&. A changed submodule can be fetched as long as it is present locally e\&.g\&. in
\fB$GIT_DIR/modules/\fR
(see
\fBgitsubmodules\fR(7)); if the upstream adds a new submodule, that submodule cannot be fetched until it is cloned e\&.g\&. by
\fBgit submodule update\fR\&.
.sp
When set to
\fIon\-demand\fR, only changed submodules are fetched\&. When set to
\fIyes\fR, all populated submodules are fetched and submodules that are both unpopulated and changed are fetched\&. When set to
\fIno\fR, submodules are never fetched\&.
.sp
When unspecified, this uses the value of
\fBfetch\&.recurseSubmodules\fR
if it is set (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1)), defaulting to
\fIon\-demand\fR
if unset\&. When this option is used without any value, it defaults to
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-j, \-\-jobs=<n>
.RS 4
Number of parallel children to be used for all forms of fetching\&.
.sp
If the
\fB\-\-multiple\fR
option was specified, the different remotes will be fetched in parallel\&. If multiple submodules are fetched, they will be fetched in parallel\&. To control them independently, use the config settings
\fBfetch\&.parallel\fR
and
\fBsubmodule\&.fetchJobs\fR
(see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.sp
Typically, parallel recursive and multi\-remote fetches will be faster\&. By default fetches are performed sequentially, not in parallel\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-recurse\-submodules
.RS 4
Disable recursive fetching of submodules (this has the same effect as using the
\fB\-\-recurse\-submodules=no\fR
option)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-set\-upstream
.RS 4
If the remote is fetched successfully, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument\-less
\fBgit-pull\fR(1)
and other commands\&. For more information, see
\fBbranch\&.<name>\&.merge\fR
and
\fBbranch\&.<name>\&.remote\fR
in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-submodule\-prefix=<path>
.RS 4
Prepend <path> to paths printed in informative messages such as "Fetching submodule foo"\&. This option is used internally when recursing over submodules\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-recurse\-submodules\-default=[yes|on\-demand]
.RS 4
This option is used internally to temporarily provide a non\-negative default value for the \-\-recurse\-submodules option\&. All other methods of configuring fetch\(cqs submodule recursion (such as settings in
\fBgitmodules\fR(5)
and
\fBgit-config\fR(1)) override this option, as does specifying \-\-[no\-]recurse\-submodules directly\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u, \-\-update\-head\-ok
.RS 4
By default
\fIgit fetch\fR
refuses to update the head which corresponds to the current branch\&. This flag disables the check\&. This is purely for the internal use for
\fIgit pull\fR
to communicate with
\fIgit fetch\fR, and unless you are implementing your own Porcelain you are not supposed to use it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-upload\-pack <upload\-pack>
.RS 4
When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled by
\fIgit fetch\-pack\fR,
\fB\-\-exec=<upload\-pack>\fR
is passed to the command to specify non\-default path for the command run on the other end\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
Pass \-\-quiet to git\-fetch\-pack and silence any other internally used git commands\&. Progress is not reported to the standard error stream\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
Be verbose\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-progress
.RS 4
Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless \-q is specified\&. This flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed to a terminal\&.
.RE
.PP
\-o <option>, \-\-server\-option=<option>
.RS 4
Transmit the given string to the server when communicating using protocol version 2\&. The given string must not contain a NUL or LF character\&. The server\(cqs handling of server options, including unknown ones, is server\-specific\&. When multiple
\fB\-\-server\-option=<option>\fR
are given, they are all sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-forced\-updates
.RS 4
By default, git checks if a branch is force\-updated during fetch\&. This can be disabled through fetch\&.showForcedUpdates, but the \-\-show\-forced\-updates option guarantees this check occurs\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-show\-forced\-updates
.RS 4
By default, git checks if a branch is force\-updated during fetch\&. Pass \-\-no\-show\-forced\-updates or set fetch\&.showForcedUpdates to false to skip this check for performance reasons\&. If used during
\fIgit\-pull\fR
the \-\-ff\-only option will still check for forced updates before attempting a fast\-forward update\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.

<repository>
.RS 4
The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch or pull operation\&. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section
GIT URLS
below) or the name of a remote (see the section
REMOTES
below)\&.
.RE
.PP
<group>
.RS 4
A name referring to a list of repositories as the value of remotes\&.<group> in the configuration file\&. (See
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
<refspec>
.RS 4
Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update\&. When no <refspec>s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch are read from
\fBremote\&.<repository>\&.fetch\fR
variables instead (see
CONFIGURED REMOTE\-TRACKING BRANCHES
below)\&.
.sp
The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus
\fB+\fR, followed by the source <src>, followed by a colon
\fB:\fR, followed by the destination ref <dst>\&. The colon can be omitted when <dst> is empty\&. <src> is typically a ref, but it can also be a fully spelled hex object name\&.
.sp
A <refspec> may contain a
\fB*\fR
in its <src> to indicate a simple pattern match\&. Such a refspec functions like a glob that matches any ref with the same prefix\&. A pattern <refspec> must have a
\fB*\fR
in both the <src> and <dst>\&. It will map refs to the destination by replacing the
\fB*\fR
with the contents matched from the source\&.
.sp
If a refspec is prefixed by
\fB^\fR, it will be interpreted as a negative refspec\&. Rather than specifying which refs to fetch or which local refs to update, such a refspec will instead specify refs to exclude\&. A ref will be considered to match if it matches at least one positive refspec, and does not match any negative refspec\&. Negative refspecs can be useful to restrict the scope of a pattern refspec so that it will not include specific refs\&. Negative refspecs can themselves be pattern refspecs\&. However, they may only contain a <src> and do not specify a <dst>\&. Fully spelled out hex object names are also not supported\&.
.sp
\fBtag <tag>\fR
means the same as
\fBrefs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>\fR; it requests fetching everything up to the given tag\&.
.sp
The remote ref that matches <src> is fetched, and if <dst> is not an empty string, an attempt is made to update the local ref that matches it\&.
.sp
Whether that update is allowed without
\fB\-\-force\fR
depends on the ref namespace it\(cqs being fetched to, the type of object being fetched, and whether the update is considered to be a fast\-forward\&. Generally, the same rules apply for fetching as when pushing, see the
\fB<refspec>\&.\&.\&.\fR
section of
\fBgit-push\fR(1)
for what those are\&. Exceptions to those rules particular to
\fIgit fetch\fR
are noted below\&.
.sp
Until Git version 2\&.20, and unlike when pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), any updates to
\fBrefs/tags/*\fR
would be accepted without
\fB+\fR
in the refspec (or
\fB\-\-force\fR)\&. When fetching, we promiscuously considered all tag updates from a remote to be forced fetches\&. Since Git version 2\&.20, fetching to update
\fBrefs/tags/*\fR
works the same way as when pushing\&. I\&.e\&. any updates will be rejected without
\fB+\fR
in the refspec (or
\fB\-\-force\fR)\&.
.sp
Unlike when pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), any updates outside of
\fBrefs/{tags,heads}/*\fR
will be accepted without
\fB+\fR
in the refspec (or
\fB\-\-force\fR), whether that\(cqs swapping e\&.g\&. a tree object for a blob, or a commit for another commit that doesn\(cqt have the previous commit as an ancestor etc\&.
.sp
Unlike when pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), there is no configuration which\(cqll amend these rules, and nothing like a
\fBpre\-fetch\fR
hook analogous to the
\fBpre\-receive\fR
hook\&.
.sp
As with pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), all of the rules described above about what\(cqs not allowed as an update can be overridden by adding an optional leading
\fB+\fR
to a refspec (or using the
\fB\-\-force\fR
command line option)\&. The only exception to this is that no amount of forcing will make the
\fBrefs/heads/*\fR
namespace accept a non\-commit object\&.

When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to be rewound and rebased regularly, it is expected that its new tip will not be a descendant of its previous tip (as stored in your remote\-tracking branch the last time you fetched)\&. You would want to use the
\fB+\fR
sign to indicate non\-fast\-forward updates will be needed for such branches\&. There is no way to determine or declare that a branch will be made available in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch\&.

.SH "GIT URLS"

In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path to the repository\&. Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent\&.

Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated; do not use them)\&.

If there are a large number of similarly\-named remote repositories and you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration section of the form:

For example, with this:

a URL like "work:repo\&.git" or like "host\&.xz:/path/to/repo\&.git" will be rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git\&.host\&.xz/repo\&.git"\&.

You often interact with the same remote repository by regularly and repeatedly fetching from it\&. In order to keep track of the progress of such a remote repository, \fBgit fetch\fR allows you to configure \fBremote\&.<repository>\&.fetch\fR configuration variables\&.

Typically such a variable may look like this:
.sp

When
\fBgit fetch\fR
is run with explicit branches and/or tags to fetch on the command line, e\&.g\&.
\fBgit fetch origin master\fR, the <refspec>s given on the command line determine what are to be fetched (e\&.g\&.
\fBmaster\fR
in the example, which is a short\-hand for
\fBmaster:\fR, which in turn means "fetch the
\fImaster\fR
branch but I do not explicitly say what remote\-tracking branch to update with it from the command line"), and the example command will fetch
\fIonly\fR
the
\fImaster\fR
branch\&. The
\fBremote\&.<repository>\&.fetch\fR
values determine which remote\-tracking branch, if any, is updated\&. When used in this way, the
\fBremote\&.<repository>\&.fetch\fR
values do not have any effect in deciding
\fIwhat\fR
gets fetched (i\&.e\&. the values are not used as refspecs when the command\-line lists refspecs); they are only used to decide
\fIwhere\fR
the refs that are fetched are stored by acting as a mapping\&.
.RE
.sp
The latter use of the \fBremote\&.<repository>\&.fetch\fR values can be overridden by giving the \fB\-\-refmap=<refspec>\fR parameter(s) on the command line\&.
.SH "PRUNING"
.sp
Git has a default disposition of keeping data unless it\(cqs explicitly thrown away; this extends to holding onto local references to branches on remotes that have themselves deleted those branches\&.
.sp
If left to accumulate, these stale references might make performance worse on big and busy repos that have a lot of branch churn, and e\&.g\&. make the output of commands like \fBgit branch \-a \-\-contains <commit>\fR needlessly verbose, as well as impacting anything else that\(cqll work with the complete set of known references\&.
.sp
These remote\-tracking references can be deleted as a one\-off with either of:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# While fetching
$ git fetch \-\-prune <name>

# Only prune, don\*(Aqt fetch
$ git remote prune <name>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
To prune references as part of your normal workflow without needing to remember to run that, set \fBfetch\&.prune\fR globally, or \fBremote\&.<name>\&.prune\fR per\-remote in the config\&. See \fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.sp
Here\(cqs where things get tricky and more specific\&. The pruning feature doesn\(cqt actually care about branches, instead it\(cqll prune local \(<-\(-> remote\-references as a function of the refspec of the remote (see \fB<refspec>\fR and CONFIGURED REMOTE\-TRACKING BRANCHES above)\&.
.sp
Therefore if the refspec for the remote includes e\&.g\&. \fBrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\fR, or you manually run e\&.g\&. \fBgit fetch \-\-prune <name> "refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*"\fR it won\(cqt be stale remote tracking branches that are deleted, but any local tag that doesn\(cqt exist on the remote\&.
.sp
This might not be what you expect, i\&.e\&. you want to prune remote \fB<name>\fR, but also explicitly fetch tags from it, so when you fetch from it you delete all your local tags, most of which may not have come from the \fB<name>\fR remote in the first place\&.
.sp
So be careful when using this with a refspec like \fBrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\fR, or any other refspec which might map references from multiple remotes to the same local namespace\&.
.sp
Since keeping up\-to\-date with both branches and tags on the remote is a common use\-case the \fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR option can be supplied along with \fB\-\-prune\fR to prune local tags that don\(cqt exist on the remote, and force\-update those tags that differ\&. Tag pruning can also be enabled with \fBfetch\&.pruneTags\fR or \fBremote\&.<name>\&.pruneTags\fR in the config\&. See \fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.sp
The \fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR option is equivalent to having \fBrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\fR declared in the refspecs of the remote\&. This can lead to some seemingly strange interactions:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# These both fetch tags
$ git fetch \-\-no\-tags origin \*(Aqrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\*(Aq
$ git fetch \-\-no\-tags \-\-prune\-tags origin
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The reason it doesn\(cqt error out when provided without \fB\-\-prune\fR or its config versions is for flexibility of the configured versions, and to maintain a 1=1 mapping between what the command line flags do, and what the configuration versions do\&.
.sp
It\(cqs reasonable to e\&.g\&. configure \fBfetch\&.pruneTags=true\fR in \fB~/\&.gitconfig\fR to have tags pruned whenever \fBgit fetch \-\-prune\fR is run, without making every invocation of \fBgit fetch\fR without \fB\-\-prune\fR an error\&.
.sp
Pruning tags with \fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR also works when fetching a URL instead of a named remote\&. These will all prune tags not found on origin:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git fetch origin \-\-prune \-\-prune\-tags
$ git fetch origin \-\-prune \*(Aqrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\*(Aq

The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be shared\&. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious peer, your best option is to store it in another repository\&. This applies to both clients and servers\&. In particular, namespaces on a server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire repository\&.

Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the attacker later\&. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has access to and then fetching it\&.

If you modify this value and your repository has a
\fBfetch\&.bundleCreationToken\fR

\fBfetch\&.bundleCreationToken\fR
value before fetching from the new bundle URI\&.

fetch\&.bundleCreationToken
.RS 4
When using
\fBfetch\&.bundleURI\fR
to fetch incrementally from a bundle list that uses the "creationToken" heuristic, this config value stores the maximum
\fBcreationToken\fR
value of the downloaded bundles\&. This value is used to prevent downloading bundles in the future if the advertised
\fBcreationToken\fR
is not strictly larger than this value\&.
.sp
The creation token values are chosen by the provider serving the specific bundle URI\&. If you modify the URI at
\fBfetch\&.bundleURI\fR, then be sure to remove the value for the
\fBfetch\&.bundleCreationToken\fR
value before fetching\&.

Using \-\-recurse\-submodules can only fetch new commits in submodules that are present locally e\&.g\&. in \fB$GIT_DIR/modules/\fR\&. If the upstream adds a new submodule, that submodule cannot be fetched until it is cloned e\&.g\&. by \fBgit submodule update\fR\&. This is expected to be fixed in a future Git version\&.
