.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Look for specified patterns in the working tree files, blobs registered in the index file, or given tree objects\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-cached
.RS 4
Instead of searching in the working tree files, check the blobs registered in the index file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-a, \-\-text
.RS 4
Process binary files as if they were text\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-ignore\-case
.RS 4
Ignore case differences between the patterns and the files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-I
.RS 4
Don\(aqt match the pattern in binary files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-max\-depth <depth>
.RS 4
For each pathspec given on command line, descend at most <depth> levels of directories\&. A negative value means no limit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-w, \-\-word\-regexp
.RS 4
Match the pattern only at word boundary (either begin at the beginning of a line, or preceded by a non\-word character; end at the end of a line or followed by a non\-word character)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-invert\-match
.RS 4
Select non\-matching lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h, \-H
.RS 4
By default, the command shows the filename for each match\&.
\-h
option is used to suppress this output\&.
\-H
is there for completeness and does not do anything except it overrides
\-h
given earlier on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-name
.RS 4
When run from a subdirectory, the command usually outputs paths relative to the current directory\&. This option forces paths to be output relative to the project top directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-E, \-\-extended\-regexp, \-G, \-\-basic\-regexp
.RS 4
Use POSIX extended/basic regexp for patterns\&. Default is to use basic regexp\&.
.RE
.PP
\-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
.RS 4
Use fixed strings for patterns (don\(aqt interpret pattern as a regex)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n
.RS 4
Prefix the line number to matching lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l, \-\-files\-with\-matches, \-\-name\-only, \-L, \-\-files\-without\-match
.RS 4
Instead of showing every matched line, show only the names of files that contain (or do not contain) matches\&. For better compatibility with
\fIgit\-diff\fR, \-\-name\-only is a synonym for \-\-files\-with\-matches\&.
.RE
.PP
\-z, \-\-null
.RS 4
Output \e0 instead of the character that normally follows a file name\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c, \-\-count
.RS 4
Instead of showing every matched line, show the number of lines that match\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color
.RS 4
Show colored matches\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-color
.RS 4
Turn off match highlighting, even when the configuration file gives the default to color output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-[ABC] <context>
.RS 4
Show
context
trailing (A
\(em after), or leading (B
\(em before), or both (C
\(em context) lines, and place a line containing
\-\-
between contiguous groups of matches\&.
.RE
.PP
\-<num>
.RS 4
A shortcut for specifying \-C<num>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-show\-function
.RS 4
Show the preceding line that contains the function name of the match, unless the matching line is a function name itself\&. The name is determined in the same way as
\fIgit diff\fR
works out patch hunk headers (see
\fIDefining a custom hunk\-header\fR
in
\fBgitattributes\fR(5))\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f <file>
.RS 4
Read patterns from <file>, one per line\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e
.RS 4
The next parameter is the pattern\&. This option has to be used for patterns starting with \- and should be used in scripts passing user input to grep\&. Multiple patterns are combined by
\fIor\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-and, \-\-or, \-\-not, ( \&... )
.RS 4
Specify how multiple patterns are combined using Boolean expressions\&.
\-\-or
is the default operator\&.
\-\-and
has higher precedence than
\-\-or\&.
\-e
has to be used for all patterns\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all\-match
.RS 4
When giving multiple pattern expressions combined with
\-\-or, this flag is specified to limit the match to files that have lines to match all of them\&.
.RE
.PP
<tree>\&...
.RS 4
Search blobs in the trees for specified patterns\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-
.RS 4
Signals the end of options; the rest of the parameters are <path> limiters\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
git grep \-e \(aq#define\(aq \-\-and \e( \-e MAX_PATH \-e PATH_MAX \e)
.RS 4
Looks for a line that has
#define
and either
MAX_PATH
or
PATH_MAX\&.
.RE
.PP
git grep \-\-all\-match \-e NODE \-e Unexpected
.RS 4
Looks for a line that has
NODE
or
Unexpected
in files that have lines that match both\&.
.RE

.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
.sp
Documentation by Junio C Hamano and the git\-list <git@vger\&.kernel\&.org>\&.
