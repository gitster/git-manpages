.SH "NAME"
git-rev-parse \- Pick out and massage parameters
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit rev\-parse\fR [<options>] <arg>\&...
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Many Git porcelainish commands take a mixture of flags (i\&.e\&. parameters that begin with a dash \fI\-\fR) and parameters meant for the underlying \fIgit rev\-list\fR command they use internally and flags and parameters for the other commands they use downstream of \fIgit rev\-list\fR\&. The primary purpose of this command is to allow calling programs to distinguish between them\&. There are a few other operation modes that have nothing to do with the above "help parse command line options"\&.
.sp
Unless otherwise specified, most of the options and operation modes require you to run this command inside a git repository or a working tree that is under the control of a git repository, and will give you a fatal error otherwise\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Operation Modes"
.sp
Each of these options must appear first on the command line\&.
.PP
\-\-parseopt
.RS 4
Use
\fIgit rev\-parse\fR
in option parsing mode (see PARSEOPT section below)\&. The command in this mode can be used outside a repository or a working tree controlled by a repository\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-sq\-quote
.RS 4
Use
\fIgit rev\-parse\fR
in shell quoting mode (see SQ\-QUOTE section below)\&. In contrast to the
\fB\-\-sq\fR
option below, this mode only does quoting\&. Nothing else is done to command input\&. The command in this mode can be used outside a repository or a working tree controlled by a repository\&.
.RE
.SS "Options for \-\-parseopt"
.PP
\-\-keep\-dashdash
.RS 4
Only meaningful in
\fB\-\-parseopt\fR
mode\&. Tells the option parser to echo out the first
\fB\-\-\fR
met instead of skipping it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stop\-at\-non\-option
.RS 4
Only meaningful in
\fB\-\-parseopt\fR
mode\&. Lets the option parser stop at the first non\-option argument\&. This can be used to parse sub\-commands that take options themselves\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stuck\-long
.RS 4
Only meaningful in
\fB\-\-parseopt\fR
mode\&. Output the options in their long form if available, and with their arguments stuck\&.
.RE
.SS "Options for Filtering"
.PP
\-\-revs\-only
.RS 4
Do not output flags and parameters not meant for
\fIgit rev\-list\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-revs
.RS 4
Do not output flags and parameters meant for
\fIgit rev\-list\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-flags
.RS 4
Do not output non\-flag parameters\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-flags
.RS 4
Do not output flag parameters\&.
.RE
.SS "Options for Output"
.PP
\-\-default <arg>
.RS 4
If there is no parameter given by the user, use
\fB<arg>\fR
instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-prefix <arg>
.RS 4
Behave as if
\fIgit rev\-parse\fR
was invoked from the
\fB<arg>\fR
subdirectory of the working tree\&. Any relative filenames are resolved as if they are prefixed by
\fB<arg>\fR
and will be printed in that form\&.
.sp
This can be used to convert arguments to a command run in a subdirectory so that they can still be used after moving to the top\-level of the repository\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
prefix=$(git rev\-parse \-\-show\-prefix)
cd "$(git rev\-parse \-\-show\-toplevel)"
# rev\-parse provides the \-\- needed for \*(Aqset\*(Aq
eval "set $(git rev\-parse \-\-sq \-\-prefix "$prefix" \-\- "$@")"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.RE
.PP
\-\-verify
.RS 4
Verify that exactly one parameter is provided, and that it can be turned into a raw 20\-byte SHA\-1 that can be used to access the object database\&. If so, emit it to the standard output; otherwise, error out\&.
.sp
If you want to make sure that the output actually names an object in your object database and/or can be used as a specific type of object you require, you can add the
\fB^{type}\fR
peeling operator to the parameter\&. For example,
\fBgit rev\-parse "$VAR^{commit}"\fR
will make sure
\fB$VAR\fR
names an existing object that is a commit\-ish (i\&.e\&. a commit, or an annotated tag that points at a commit)\&. To make sure that
\fB$VAR\fR
names an existing object of any type,
\fBgit rev\-parse "$VAR^{object}"\fR
can be used\&.
.sp
Note that if you are verifying a name from an untrusted source, it is wise to use
\fB\-\-end\-of\-options\fR
so that the name argument is not mistaken for another option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
Only meaningful in
\fB\-\-verify\fR
mode\&. Do not output an error message if the first argument is not a valid object name; instead exit with non\-zero status silently\&. SHA\-1s for valid object names are printed to stdout on success\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-sq
.RS 4
Usually the output is made one line per flag and parameter\&. This option makes output a single line, properly quoted for consumption by shell\&. Useful when you expect your parameter to contain whitespaces and newlines (e\&.g\&. when using pickaxe
\fB\-S\fR
with
\fIgit diff\-*\fR)\&. In contrast to the
\fB\-\-sq\-quote\fR
option, the command input is still interpreted as usual\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-short[=<length>]
.RS 4
Same as
\fB\-\-verify\fR
but shortens the object name to a unique prefix with at least
\fBlength\fR
characters\&. The minimum length is 4, the default is the effective value of the
\fBcore\&.abbrev\fR
configuration variable (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-not
.RS 4
When showing object names, prefix them with
\fI^\fR
and strip
\fI^\fR
prefix from the object names that already have one\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev\-ref[=(strict|loose)]
.RS 4
A non\-ambiguous short name of the objects name\&. The option core\&.warnAmbiguousRefs is used to select the strict abbreviation mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-symbolic
.RS 4
Usually the object names are output in SHA\-1 form (with possible
\fI^\fR
prefix); this option makes them output in a form as close to the original input as possible\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-symbolic\-full\-name
.RS 4
This is similar to \-\-symbolic, but it omits input that are not refs (i\&.e\&. branch or tag names; or more explicitly disambiguating "heads/master" form, when you want to name the "master" branch when there is an unfortunately named tag "master"), and shows them as full refnames (e\&.g\&. "refs/heads/master")\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-output\-object\-format=(sha1|sha256|storage)
.RS 4
Allow oids to be input from any object format that the current repository supports\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
Specifying "sha1" translates if necessary and returns a sha1 oid\&.
.fi
.if n \{\

Specifying "sha256" translates if necessary and returns a sha256 oid\&.

.RE
.SS "Options for Objects"
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
Show all refs found in
\fBrefs/\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-branches[=<pattern>], \-\-tags[=<pattern>], \-\-remotes[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Show all branches, tags, or remote\-tracking branches, respectively (i\&.e\&., refs found in
\fBrefs/heads\fR,
\fBrefs/tags\fR, or
\fBrefs/remotes\fR, respectively)\&.
.sp
If a
\fBpattern\fR
is given, only refs matching the given shell glob are shown\&. If the pattern does not contain a globbing character (\fB?\fR,
\fB*\fR, or
\fB[\fR), it is turned into a prefix match by appending
\fB/*\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-glob=<pattern>
.RS 4
Show all refs matching the shell glob pattern
\fBpattern\fR\&. If the pattern does not start with
\fBrefs/\fR, this is automatically prepended\&. If the pattern does not contain a globbing character (\fB?\fR,
\fB*\fR, or
\fB[\fR), it is turned into a prefix match by appending
\fB/*\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exclude=<glob\-pattern>
.RS 4
Do not include refs matching
\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
that the next
\fB\-\-all\fR,
\fB\-\-branches\fR,
\fB\-\-tags\fR,
\fB\-\-remotes\fR, or
\fB\-\-glob\fR
would otherwise consider\&. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to the next
\fB\-\-all\fR,
\fB\-\-branches\fR,
\fB\-\-tags\fR,
\fB\-\-remotes\fR, or
\fB\-\-glob\fR
option (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns)\&.
.sp
The patterns given should not begin with
\fBrefs/heads\fR,
\fBrefs/tags\fR, or
\fBrefs/remotes\fR
when applied to
\fB\-\-branches\fR,
\fB\-\-tags\fR, or
\fB\-\-remotes\fR, respectively, and they must begin with
\fBrefs/\fR
when applied to
\fB\-\-glob\fR
or
\fB\-\-all\fR\&. If a trailing
\fI/*\fR
is intended, it must be given explicitly\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exclude\-hidden=(fetch|receive|uploadpack)
.RS 4
Do not include refs that would be hidden by
\fBgit\-fetch\fR,
\fBgit\-receive\-pack\fR
or
\fBgit\-upload\-pack\fR
by consulting the appropriate
\fBfetch\&.hideRefs\fR,
\fBreceive\&.hideRefs\fR
or
\fBuploadpack\&.hideRefs\fR
configuration along with
\fBtransfer\&.hideRefs\fR
(see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. This option affects the next pseudo\-ref option
\fB\-\-all\fR
or
\fB\-\-glob\fR
and is cleared after processing them\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-disambiguate=<prefix>
.RS 4
Show every object whose name begins with the given prefix\&. The <prefix> must be at least 4 hexadecimal digits long to avoid listing each and every object in the repository by mistake\&.
.RE
.SS "Options for Files"
.PP
\-\-local\-env\-vars
.RS 4
List the GIT_* environment variables that are local to the repository (e\&.g\&. GIT_DIR or GIT_WORK_TREE, but not GIT_EDITOR)\&. Only the names of the variables are listed, not their value, even if they are set\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-path\-format=(absolute|relative)
.RS 4
Controls the behavior of certain other options\&. If specified as absolute, the paths printed by those options will be absolute and canonical\&. If specified as relative, the paths will be relative to the current working directory if that is possible\&. The default is option specific\&.
.sp
This option may be specified multiple times and affects only the arguments that follow it on the command line, either to the end of the command line or the next instance of this option\&.
.RE
.sp
The following options are modified by \fB\-\-path\-format\fR:
.PP
\-\-git\-dir
.RS 4
Show
\fB$GIT_DIR\fR
if defined\&. Otherwise show the path to the \&.git directory\&. The path shown, when relative, is relative to the current working directory\&.
.sp
If
\fB$GIT_DIR\fR
is not defined and the current directory is not detected to lie in a Git repository or work tree print a message to stderr and exit with nonzero status\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-git\-common\-dir

Show
\fB$GIT_COMMON_DIR\fR
if defined, else
\fB$GIT_DIR\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-resolve\-git\-dir <path>
.RS 4
Check if <path> is a valid repository or a gitfile that points at a valid repository, and print the location of the repository\&. If <path> is a gitfile then the resolved path to the real repository is printed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-git\-path <path>
.RS 4
Resolve "$GIT_DIR/<path>" and takes other path relocation variables such as $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY, $GIT_INDEX_FILE\&... into account\&. For example, if $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY is set to /foo/bar then "git rev\-parse \-\-git\-path objects/abc" returns /foo/bar/abc\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-toplevel
.RS 4
Show the (by default, absolute) path of the top\-level directory of the working tree\&. If there is no working tree, report an error\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-superproject\-working\-tree
.RS 4
Show the absolute path of the root of the superproject\(cqs working tree (if exists) that uses the current repository as its submodule\&. Outputs nothing if the current repository is not used as a submodule by any project\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-shared\-index\-path
.RS 4
Show the path to the shared index file in split index mode, or empty if not in split\-index mode\&.
.RE
.sp
The following options are unaffected by \fB\-\-path\-format\fR:
.PP
\-\-absolute\-git\-dir
.RS 4
Like
\fB\-\-git\-dir\fR, but its output is always the canonicalized absolute path\&.

.SH "SPECIFYING RANGES"
.sp
History traversing commands such as \fBgit log\fR operate on a set of commits, not just a single commit\&.
.sp
For these commands, specifying a single revision, using the notation described in the previous section, means the set of commits \fBreachable\fR from the given commit\&.
.sp
Specifying several revisions means the set of commits reachable from any of the given commits\&.
.sp
A commit\(cqs reachable set is the commit itself and the commits in its ancestry chain\&.
.sp
There are several notations to specify a set of connected commits (called a "revision range"), illustrated below\&.
.SS "Commit Exclusions"
.PP
\fI^<rev>\fR (caret) Notation
.RS 4
To exclude commits reachable from a commit, a prefix
\fI^\fR
notation is used\&. E\&.g\&.
\fI^r1 r2\fR
means commits reachable from
\fIr2\fR
but exclude the ones reachable from
\fIr1\fR
(i\&.e\&.
\fIr1\fR
and its ancestors)\&.
.RE
.SS "Dotted Range Notations"
.PP
The \fI\&.\&.\fR (two\-dot) Range Notation
.RS 4
The
\fI^r1 r2\fR
set operation appears so often that there is a shorthand for it\&. When you have two commits
\fIr1\fR
and
\fIr2\fR
(named according to the syntax explained in SPECIFYING REVISIONS above), you can ask for commits that are reachable from r2 excluding those that are reachable from r1 by
\fI^r1 r2\fR
and it can be written as
\fIr1\&.\&.r2\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
The \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR (three\-dot) Symmetric Difference Notation
.RS 4
A similar notation
\fIr1\&.\&.\&.r2\fR
is called symmetric difference of
\fIr1\fR
and
\fIr2\fR
and is defined as
\fIr1 r2 \-\-not $(git merge\-base \-\-all r1 r2)\fR\&. It is the set of commits that are reachable from either one of
\fIr1\fR
(left side) or
\fIr2\fR
(right side) but not from both\&.
.RE
.sp
In these two shorthand notations, you can omit one end and let it default to HEAD\&. For example, \fIorigin\&.\&.\fR is a shorthand for \fIorigin\&.\&.HEAD\fR and asks "What did I do since I forked from the origin branch?" Similarly, \fI\&.\&.origin\fR is a shorthand for \fIHEAD\&.\&.origin\fR and asks "What did the origin do since I forked from them?" Note that \fI\&.\&.\fR would mean \fIHEAD\&.\&.HEAD\fR which is an empty range that is both reachable and unreachable from HEAD\&.
.sp
Commands that are specifically designed to take two distinct ranges (e\&.g\&. "git range\-diff R1 R2" to compare two ranges) do exist, but they are exceptions\&. Unless otherwise noted, all "git" commands that operate on a set of commits work on a single revision range\&. In other words, writing two "two\-dot range notation" next to each other, e\&.g\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log A\&.\&.B C\&.\&.D
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
does \fBnot\fR specify two revision ranges for most commands\&. Instead it will name a single connected set of commits, i\&.e\&. those that are reachable from either B or D but are reachable from neither A or C\&. In a linear history like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-\-\-A\-\-\-B\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-C\-\-\-D
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
because A and B are reachable from C, the revision range specified by these two dotted ranges is a single commit D\&.
.SS "Other <rev>^ Parent Shorthand Notations"
.sp
Three other shorthands exist, particularly useful for merge commits, for naming a set that is formed by a commit and its parent commits\&.
.sp
The \fIr1^@\fR notation means all parents of \fIr1\fR\&.
.sp
The \fIr1^!\fR notation includes commit \fIr1\fR but excludes all of its parents\&. By itself, this notation denotes the single commit \fIr1\fR\&.
.sp
The \fI<rev>^\-[<n>]\fR notation includes \fI<rev>\fR but excludes the <n>th parent (i\&.e\&. a shorthand for \fI<rev>^<n>\&.\&.<rev>\fR), with \fI<n>\fR = 1 if not given\&. This is typically useful for merge commits where you can just pass \fI<commit>^\-\fR to get all the commits in the branch that was merged in merge commit \fI<commit>\fR (including \fI<commit>\fR itself)\&.
.sp
While \fI<rev>^<n>\fR was about specifying a single commit parent, these three notations also consider its parents\&. For example you can say \fIHEAD^2^@\fR, however you cannot say \fIHEAD^@^2\fR\&.

.SH "PARSEOPT"

In \fB\-\-parseopt\fR mode, \fIgit rev\-parse\fR helps massaging options to bring to shell scripts the same facilities C builtins have\&. It works as an option normalizer (e\&.g\&. splits single switches aggregate values), a bit like \fBgetopt(1)\fR does\&.
.sp
It takes on the standard input the specification of the options to parse and understand, and echoes on the standard output a string suitable for \fBsh(1)\fR \fBeval\fR to replace the arguments with normalized ones\&. In case of error, it outputs usage on the standard error stream, and exits with code 129\&.

\fIgit rev\-parse \-\-parseopt\fR input format is fully text based\&. It has two parts, separated by a line that contains only \fB\-\-\fR\&. The lines before the separator (should be one or more) are used for the usage\&. The lines after the separator describe the options\&.
