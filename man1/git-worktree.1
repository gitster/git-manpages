.SH "NAME"
git-worktree \- Manage multiple working trees
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit worktree add\fR [\-f] [\-\-detach] [\-b <new\-branch>] <path> [<branch>]
\fIgit worktree prune\fR [\-n] [\-v] [\-\-expire <expire>]
\fIgit worktree list\fR [\-\-porcelain]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository\&.
.sp
A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to check out more than one branch at a time\&. With git worktree add a new working tree is associated with the repository\&. This new working tree is called a "linked working tree" as opposed to the "main working tree" prepared by "git init" or "git clone"\&. A repository has one main working tree (if it\(cqs not a bare repository) and zero or more linked working trees\&.
.sp
When you are done with a linked working tree you can simply delete it\&. The working tree\(cqs administrative files in the repository (see "DETAILS" below) will eventually be removed automatically (see gc\&.worktreePruneExpire in \fBgit-config\fR(1)), or you can run git worktree prune in the main or any linked working tree to clean up any stale administrative files\&.
.sp
If you move a linked working tree, you need to manually update the administrative files so that they do not get pruned automatically\&. See section "DETAILS" for more information\&.
.sp
If a linked working tree is stored on a portable device or network share which is not always mounted, you can prevent its administrative files from being pruned by creating a file named \fIlocked\fR alongside the other administrative files, optionally containing a plain text reason that pruning should be suppressed\&. See section "DETAILS" for more information\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
add <path> [<branch>]
.RS 4
Create
<path>
and checkout
<branch>
into it\&. The new working directory is linked to the current repository, sharing everything except working directory specific files such as HEAD, index, etc\&.
.sp
If
<branch>
is omitted and neither
\-b
nor
\-B
nor
\-\-detached
used, then, as a convenience, a new branch based at HEAD is created automatically, as if
\-b $(basename <path>)
was specified\&.
.RE
.PP
prune
.RS 4
Prune working tree information in $GIT_DIR/worktrees\&.
.RE
.PP
list
.RS 4
List details of each worktree\&. The main worktree is listed first, followed by each of the linked worktrees\&. The output details include if the worktree is bare, the revision currently checked out, and the branch currently checked out (or
\fIdetached HEAD\fR
if none)\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f, \-\-force
.RS 4
By default,
add
refuses to create a new working tree when
<branch>
is already checked out by another working tree\&. This option overrides that safeguard\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b <new\-branch>, \-B <new\-branch>
.RS 4
With
add, create a new branch named
<new\-branch>
starting at
<branch>, and check out
<new\-branch>
into the new working tree\&. If
<branch>
is omitted, it defaults to HEAD\&. By default,
\-b
refuses to create a new branch if it already exists\&.
\-B
overrides this safeguard, resetting
<new\-branch>
to
<branch>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-detach
.RS 4
With
add, detach HEAD in the new working tree\&. See "DETACHED HEAD" in
\fBgit-checkout\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-dry\-run
.RS 4
With
prune, do not remove anything; just report what it would remove\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-porcelain
.RS 4
With
list, output in an easy\-to\-parse format for scripts\&. This format will remain stable across Git versions and regardless of user configuration\&. See below for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
With
prune, report all removals\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-expire <time>
.RS 4
With
prune, only expire unused working trees older than <time>\&.
.RE
.SH "DETAILS"
.sp
Each linked working tree has a private sub\-directory in the repository\(cqs $GIT_DIR/worktrees directory\&. The private sub\-directory\(cqs name is usually the base name of the linked working tree\(cqs path, possibly appended with a number to make it unique\&. For example, when $GIT_DIR=/path/main/\&.git the command git worktree add /path/other/test\-next next creates the linked working tree in /path/other/test\-next and also creates a $GIT_DIR/worktrees/test\-next directory (or $GIT_DIR/worktrees/test\-next1 if test\-next is already taken)\&.
.sp
Within a linked working tree, $GIT_DIR is set to point to this private directory (e\&.g\&. /path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next in the example) and $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set to point back to the main working tree\(cqs $GIT_DIR (e\&.g\&. /path/main/\&.git)\&. These settings are made in a \&.git file located at the top directory of the linked working tree\&.
.sp
Path resolution via git rev\-parse \-\-git\-path uses either $GIT_DIR or $GIT_COMMON_DIR depending on the path\&. For example, in the linked working tree git rev\-parse \-\-git\-path HEAD returns /path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next/HEAD (not /path/other/test\-next/\&.git/HEAD or /path/main/\&.git/HEAD) while git rev\-parse \-\-git\-path refs/heads/master uses $GIT_COMMON_DIR and returns /path/main/\&.git/refs/heads/master, since refs are shared across all working trees\&.
.sp
See \fBgitrepository-layout\fR(5) for more information\&. The rule of thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a path belongs to $GIT_DIR or $GIT_COMMON_DIR when you need to directly access something inside $GIT_DIR\&. Use git rev\-parse \-\-git\-path to get the final path\&.
.sp
If you move a linked working tree, you need to update the \fIgitdir\fR file in the entry\(cqs directory\&. For example, if a linked working tree is moved to /newpath/test\-next and its \&.git file points to /path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next, then update /path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next/gitdir to reference /newpath/test\-next instead\&.
.sp
To prevent a $GIT_DIR/worktrees entry from being pruned (which can be useful in some situations, such as when the entry\(cqs working tree is stored on a portable device), add a file named \fIlocked\fR to the entry\(cqs directory\&. The file contains the reason in plain text\&. For example, if a linked working tree\(cqs \&.git file points to /path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next then a file named /path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next/locked will prevent the test\-next entry from being pruned\&. See \fBgitrepository-layout\fR(5) for details\&.
.SH "LIST OUTPUT FORMAT"
.sp
The worktree list command has two output formats\&. The default format shows the details on a single line with columns\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
S git worktree list
/path/to/bare\-source            (bare)
/path/to/linked\-worktree        abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/other\-linked\-worktree  1234abc  (detached HEAD)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SS "Porcelain Format"
.sp
The porcelain format has a line per attribute\&. Attributes are listed with a label and value separated by a single space\&. Boolean attributes (like \fIbare\fR and \fIdetached\fR) are listed as a label only, and are only present if and only if the value is true\&. An empty line indicates the end of a worktree\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
S git worktree list \-\-porcelain
worktree /path/to/bare\-source
bare

worktree /path/to/linked\-worktree
HEAD abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234
branch refs/heads/master

worktree /path/to/other\-linked\-worktree
HEAD 1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234a
detached
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
You are in the middle of a refactoring session and your boss comes in and demands that you fix something immediately\&. You might typically use \fBgit-stash\fR(1) to store your changes away temporarily, however, your working tree is in such a state of disarray (with new, moved, and removed files, and other bits and pieces strewn around) that you don\(cqt want to risk disturbing any of it\&. Instead, you create a temporary linked working tree to make the emergency fix, remove it when done, and then resume your earlier refactoring session\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git worktree add \-b emergency\-fix \&.\&./temp master
$ pushd \&.\&./temp
# \&.\&.\&. hack hack hack \&.\&.\&.
$ git commit \-a \-m \(aqemergency fix for boss\(aq
$ popd
$ rm \-rf \&.\&./temp
$ git worktree prune
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
Multiple checkout in general is still experimental, and the support for submodules is incomplete\&. It is NOT recommended to make multiple checkouts of a superproject\&.
.sp
git\-worktree could provide more automation for tasks currently performed manually, such as:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
remove
to remove a linked working tree and its administrative files (and warn if the working tree is dirty)
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
mv
to move or rename a working tree and update its administrative files
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
lock
to prevent automatic pruning of administrative files (for instance, for a working tree on a portable device)
