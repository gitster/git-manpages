git-worktree \- Manage multiple working trees
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp

\fIgit worktree add\fR [\-f] [\-\-detach] [\-\-checkout] [\-b <new\-branch>] <path> [<branch>]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository\&.
.sp
A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to check out more than one branch at a time\&. With \fBgit worktree add\fR a new working tree is associated with the repository\&. This new working tree is called a "linked working tree" as opposed to the "main working tree" prepared by "git init" or "git clone"\&. A repository has one main working tree (if it\(cqs not a bare repository) and zero or more linked working trees\&.
.sp
When you are done with a linked working tree you can simply delete it\&. The working tree\(cqs administrative files in the repository (see "DETAILS" below) will eventually be removed automatically (see \fBgc\&.worktreePruneExpire\fR in \fBgit-config\fR(1)), or you can run \fBgit worktree prune\fR in the main or any linked working tree to clean up any stale administrative files\&.
.sp
If you move a linked working tree, you need to manually update the administrative files so that they do not get pruned automatically\&. See section "DETAILS" for more information\&.
.sp
If a linked working tree is stored on a portable device or network share which is not always mounted, you can prevent its administrative files from being pruned by creating a file named \fIlocked\fR alongside the other administrative files, optionally containing a plain text reason that pruning should be suppressed\&. See section "DETAILS" for more information\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
add <path> [<branch>]
.RS 4
Create
\fB<path>\fR
and checkout
\fB<branch>\fR
into it\&. The new working directory is linked to the current repository, sharing everything except working directory specific files such as HEAD, index, etc\&.
\fB\-\fR
may also be specified as
\fB<branch>\fR; it is synonymous with
\fB@{\-1}\fR\&.
.sp
If
\fB<branch>\fR
is omitted and neither
\fB\-b\fR
nor
\fB\-B\fR
nor
\fB\-\-detached\fR
used, then, as a convenience, a new branch based at HEAD is created automatically, as if
\fB\-b $(basename <path>)\fR
was specified\&.
.RE
.PP
prune
.RS 4
Prune working tree information in $GIT_DIR/worktrees\&.
.RE
.PP
list
.RS 4
List details of each worktree\&. The main worktree is listed first, followed by each of the linked worktrees\&. The output details include if the worktree is bare, the revision currently checked out, and the branch currently checked out (or
\fIdetached HEAD\fR
if none)\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f, \-\-force
.RS 4
By default,
\fBadd\fR
refuses to create a new working tree when
\fB<branch>\fR
is already checked out by another working tree\&. This option overrides that safeguard\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b <new\-branch>, \-B <new\-branch>
.RS 4
With
\fBadd\fR, create a new branch named
\fB<new\-branch>\fR
starting at
\fB<branch>\fR, and check out
\fB<new\-branch>\fR
into the new working tree\&. If
\fB<branch>\fR
is omitted, it defaults to HEAD\&. By default,
\fB\-b\fR
refuses to create a new branch if it already exists\&.
\fB\-B\fR
overrides this safeguard, resetting
\fB<new\-branch>\fR
to
\fB<branch>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-detach
.RS 4
With
\fBadd\fR, detach HEAD in the new working tree\&. See "DETACHED HEAD" in
\fBgit-checkout\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]checkout
.RS 4
By default,
\fBadd\fR
checks out
\fB<branch>\fR, however,
\fB\-\-no\-checkout\fR
can be used to suppress checkout in order to make customizations, such as configuring sparse\-checkout\&. See "Sparse checkout" in
\fBgit-read-tree\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-dry\-run
.RS 4
With
\fBprune\fR, do not remove anything; just report what it would remove\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-porcelain
.RS 4
With
\fBlist\fR, output in an easy\-to\-parse format for scripts\&. This format will remain stable across Git versions and regardless of user configuration\&. See below for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
With
\fBprune\fR, report all removals\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-expire <time>
.RS 4
With
\fBprune\fR, only expire unused working trees older than <time>\&.
.RE
.SH "DETAILS"
.sp
Each linked working tree has a private sub\-directory in the repository\(cqs $GIT_DIR/worktrees directory\&. The private sub\-directory\(cqs name is usually the base name of the linked working tree\(cqs path, possibly appended with a number to make it unique\&. For example, when \fB$GIT_DIR=/path/main/\&.git\fR the command \fBgit worktree add /path/other/test\-next next\fR creates the linked working tree in \fB/path/other/test\-next\fR and also creates a \fB$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test\-next\fR directory (or \fB$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test\-next1\fR if \fBtest\-next\fR is already taken)\&.
.sp
Within a linked working tree, $GIT_DIR is set to point to this private directory (e\&.g\&. \fB/path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next\fR in the example) and $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set to point back to the main working tree\(cqs $GIT_DIR (e\&.g\&. \fB/path/main/\&.git\fR)\&. These settings are made in a \fB\&.git\fR file located at the top directory of the linked working tree\&.
.sp
Path resolution via \fBgit rev\-parse \-\-git\-path\fR uses either $GIT_DIR or $GIT_COMMON_DIR depending on the path\&. For example, in the linked working tree \fBgit rev\-parse \-\-git\-path HEAD\fR returns \fB/path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next/HEAD\fR (not \fB/path/other/test\-next/\&.git/HEAD\fR or \fB/path/main/\&.git/HEAD\fR) while \fBgit rev\-parse \-\-git\-path refs/heads/master\fR uses $GIT_COMMON_DIR and returns \fB/path/main/\&.git/refs/heads/master\fR, since refs are shared across all working trees\&.
.sp
See \fBgitrepository-layout\fR(5) for more information\&. The rule of thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a path belongs to $GIT_DIR or $GIT_COMMON_DIR when you need to directly access something inside $GIT_DIR\&. Use \fBgit rev\-parse \-\-git\-path\fR to get the final path\&.
.sp
If you move a linked working tree, you need to update the \fIgitdir\fR file in the entry\(cqs directory\&. For example, if a linked working tree is moved to \fB/newpath/test\-next\fR and its \fB\&.git\fR file points to \fB/path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next\fR, then update \fB/path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next/gitdir\fR to reference \fB/newpath/test\-next\fR instead\&.
.sp
To prevent a $GIT_DIR/worktrees entry from being pruned (which can be useful in some situations, such as when the entry\(cqs working tree is stored on a portable device), add a file named \fIlocked\fR to the entry\(cqs directory\&. The file contains the reason in plain text\&. For example, if a linked working tree\(cqs \fB\&.git\fR file points to \fB/path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next\fR then a file named \fB/path/main/\&.git/worktrees/test\-next/locked\fR will prevent the \fBtest\-next\fR entry from being pruned\&. See \fBgitrepository-layout\fR(5) for details\&.
.SH "LIST OUTPUT FORMAT"
.sp
The worktree list command has two output formats\&. The default format shows the details on a single line with columns\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
S git worktree list
/path/to/bare\-source            (bare)
/path/to/linked\-worktree        abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/other\-linked\-worktree  1234abc  (detached HEAD)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SS "Porcelain Format"
.sp
The porcelain format has a line per attribute\&. Attributes are listed with a label and value separated by a single space\&. Boolean attributes (like \fIbare\fR and \fIdetached\fR) are listed as a label only, and are only present if and only if the value is true\&. An empty line indicates the end of a worktree\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
S git worktree list \-\-porcelain
worktree /path/to/bare\-source
bare

worktree /path/to/linked\-worktree
HEAD abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234
branch refs/heads/master

worktree /path/to/other\-linked\-worktree
HEAD 1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234a
detached
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
You are in the middle of a refactoring session and your boss comes in and demands that you fix something immediately\&. You might typically use \fBgit-stash\fR(1) to store your changes away temporarily, however, your working tree is in such a state of disarray (with new, moved, and removed files, and other bits and pieces strewn around) that you don\(cqt want to risk disturbing any of it\&. Instead, you create a temporary linked working tree to make the emergency fix, remove it when done, and then resume your earlier refactoring session\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git worktree add \-b emergency\-fix \&.\&./temp master
$ pushd \&.\&./temp
# \&.\&.\&. hack hack hack \&.\&.\&.
$ git commit \-a \-m \(aqemergency fix for boss\(aq
$ popd
$ rm \-rf \&.\&./temp
$ git worktree prune
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
Multiple checkout in general is still experimental, and the support for submodules is incomplete\&. It is NOT recommended to make multiple checkouts of a superproject\&.
.sp
git\-worktree could provide more automation for tasks currently performed manually, such as:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBremove\fR
to remove a linked working tree and its administrative files (and warn if the working tree is dirty)
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBmv\fR
to move or rename a working tree and update its administrative files
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBlock\fR
to prevent automatic pruning of administrative files (for instance, for a working tree on a portable device)
