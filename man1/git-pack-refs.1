.SH "NAME"
git-pack-refs \- Pack heads and tags for efficient repository access
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fIgit pack\-refs\fR [\-\-all] [\-\-no\-prune]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known as \fIrefs\fR) were stored one file per ref under $GIT_DIR/refs directory\&. While many branch tips tend to be updated often, most tags and some branch tips are never updated\&. When a repository has hundreds or thousands of tags, this one\-file\-per\-ref format both wastes storage and hurts performance\&.
.sp
This command is used to solve the storage and performance problem by stashing the refs in a single file, $GIT_DIR/packed\-refs\&. When a ref is missing from the traditional $GIT_DIR/refs hierarchy, it is looked up in this file and used if found\&.
.sp
Subsequent updates to branches always create new files under $GIT_DIR/refs hierarchy\&.
.sp
A recommended practice to deal with a repository with too many refs is to pack its refs with \-\-all \-\-prune once, and occasionally run git pack\-refs \-\-prune\&. Tags are by definition stationary and are not expected to change\&. Branch heads will be packed with the initial pack\-refs \-\-all, but only the currently active branch heads will become unpacked, and the next pack\-refs (without \-\-all) will leave them unpacked\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
The command by default packs all tags and refs that are already packed, and leaves other refs alone\&. This is because branches are expected to be actively developed and packing their tips does not help performance\&. This option causes branch tips to be packed as well\&. Useful for a repository with many branches of historical interests\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-prune
.RS 4
The command usually removes loose refs under
$GIT_DIR/refs
hierarchy after packing them\&. This option tells it not to\&.
