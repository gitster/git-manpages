\fBgit\fR \fBdiff\fR [\fI<options>\fR] [\fB\-\-\fR] [\fI<path>\fR\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
This form is to view the changes you made relative to the index (staging area for the next commit)\&. In other words, the differences are what you
\fIcould\fR
tell Git to further add to the index but you still haven\(cqt\&. You can stage these changes by using

.RS 4
This form is to compare the given two paths on the filesystem\&. You can omit the
\fB\-\-no\-index\fR
option when running the command in a working tree controlled by Git and at least one of the paths points outside the working tree, or when running the command outside a working tree controlled by Git\&. This form implies
\fB\-\-exit\-code\fR\&. If both paths point to directories, additional pathspecs may be provided\&. These will limit the files included in the difference\&. All such pathspecs must be relative as they apply to both sides of the diff\&.

.RS 4
This form is to view the changes you staged for the next commit relative to the named
\fI<commit>\fR\&. Typically you would want comparison with the latest commit, so if you do not give
\fI<commit>\fR, it defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR\&. If
\fBHEAD\fR
does not exist (e\&.g\&. unborn branches) and
\fI<commit>\fR
is not given, it shows all staged changes\&.
\fB\-\-staged\fR

.RS 4
This form is to view the results of a merge commit\&. The first listed
\fI<commit>\fR
must be the merge itself; the remaining two or more commits should be its parents\&. Convenient ways to produce the desired set of revisions are to use the suffixes
\fB@\fR

This is synonymous to the earlier form (without the

.RE
.sp
Just in case you are doing something exotic, it should be noted that all of the \fI<commit>\fR in the above description, except in the \fB\-\-merge\-base\fR case and in the last two forms that use \fB\&.\&.\fR notations, can be any \fI<tree>\fR\&. A tree of interest is the one pointed to by the ref named \fBAUTO_MERGE\fR, which is written by the \fBort\fR merge strategy upon hitting merge conflicts (see \fBgit-merge\fR(1))\&. Comparing the working tree with \fBAUTO_MERGE\fR shows changes you\(cqve made so far to resolve textual conflicts (see the examples below)\&.
.sp
For a more complete list of ways to spell \fI<commit>\fR, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in \fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&. However, \fBdiff\fR is about comparing two \fIendpoints\fR, not ranges, and the range notations (\fI<commit>\fR\fB\&.\&.\fR\fI<commit>\fR and \fI<commit>\fR\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR\fI<commit>\fR) do not mean a range as defined in the "SPECIFYING RANGES" section in \fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.

Generate patch (see
the section called \(lqGENERATING PATCH TEXT WITH \-P\(rq)\&. This is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-no\-patch\fR
.RS 4
Suppress all output from the diff machinery\&. Useful for commands like
\fBgit\fR
\fBshow\fR
that show the patch by default to squelch their output, or to cancel the effect of options like
\fB\-\-patch\fR,
\fB\-\-stat\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-U\fR\fI<n>\fR, \fB\-\-unified=\fR\fI<n>\fR

Specify the character used to indicate new, old or context lines in the generated patch\&. Normally they are
\fB+\fR,
\fB\-\fR
and \*(Aq \*(Aq respectively\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-anchored=\fR\fI<text>\fR

Generate a diff using the "anchored diff" algorithm\&.
.sp
This option may be specified more than once\&.
.sp
If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only once, and starts with
\fI<text>\fR, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from appearing as a deletion or addition in the output\&. It uses the "patience diff" algorithm internally\&.
.RE

.RE
.sp
For instance, if you configured the

\fB\-\-diff\-algorithm=default\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stat\fR[\fB=\fR\fI<width>\fR[\fB,\fR\fI<name\-width>\fR[\fB,\fR\fI<count>\fR]]]
.RS 4
Generate a diffstat\&. By default, as much space as necessary will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part\&. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a terminal, and can be overridden by
\fI<width>\fR\&. The width of the filename part can be limited by giving another width
\fI<name\-width>\fR
after a comma or by setting
\fBdiff\&.statNameWidth=\fR\fI<name\-width>\fR\&. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
\fB\-\-stat\-graph\-width=\fR\fI<graph\-width>\fR
or by setting
\fBdiff\&.statGraphWidth=\fR\fI<graph\-width>\fR\&. Using
\fB\-\-stat\fR
or
\fB\-\-stat\-graph\-width\fR
affects all commands generating a stat graph, while setting
\fBdiff\&.statNameWidth\fR
or
\fBdiff\&.statGraphWidth\fR
does not affect
\fBgit\fR
\fBformat\-patch\fR\&. By giving a third parameter
\fI<count>\fR, you can limit the output to the first
\fI<count>\fR
lines, followed by
\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR
if there are more\&.
.sp
These parameters can also be set individually with
\fB\-\-stat\-width=\fR\fI<width>\fR,
\fB\-\-stat\-name\-width=\fR\fI<name\-width>\fR
and
\fB\-\-stat\-count=\fR\fI<count>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-compact\-summary\fR
.RS 4
Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as file creations or deletions ("new" or "gone", optionally
\fB+l\fR
if it\(cqs a symlink) and mode changes (\fB+x\fR
or
\fB\-x\fR
for adding or removing executable bit respectively) in diffstat\&. The information is put between the filename part and the graph part\&. Implies
\fB\-\-stat\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-numstat\fR
.RS 4
Similar to
\fB\-\-stat\fR, but shows number of added and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly\&. For binary files, outputs two
\fB\-\fR
instead of saying
\fB0\fR
\fB0\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-shortstat\fR
.RS 4
Output only the last line of the
\fB\-\-stat\fR
format containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-X\fR [\fI<param>\fR\fB,\fR\&.\&.\&.], \fB\-\-dirstat\fR[\fB=\fR\fI<param>\fR\fB,\fR\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each sub\-directory\&. The behavior of
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
can be customized by passing it a comma separated list of parameters\&. The defaults are controlled by the
\fBdiff\&.dirstat\fR
configuration variable (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. The following parameters are available:
.PP
\fBchanges\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed from the source, or added to the destination\&. This ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file\&. In other words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes\&. This is the default behavior when no parameter is given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlines\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line\-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts\&. (For binary files, count 64\-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept of lines)\&. This is a more expensive
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
behavior than the
\fBchanges\fR
behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as much as other changes\&. The resulting output is consistent with what you get from the other
\fB\-\-*stat\fR
options\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfiles\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed\&. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis\&. This is the computationally cheapest
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
behavior, since it does not have to look at the file contents at all\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcumulative\fR
.RS 4
Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well\&. Note that when using
\fBcumulative\fR, the sum of the percentages reported may exceed 100%\&. The default (non\-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
\fBnoncumulative\fR
parameter\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI<limit>\fR
.RS 4
An integer parameter specifies a cut\-off percent (3% by default)\&. Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are not shown in the output\&.
.RE
.sp
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
\fB\-\-dirstat=files\fR,10,cumulative\&.

.RS 4
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create\&. This serves two purposes:
.sp
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
\fI<m>\fR
controls this aspect of the
\fB\-B\fR
option (defaults to 60%)\&.
\fB\-B/70%\fR
specifies that less than 30% of the original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i\&.e\&. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines)\&.
.sp
When used with
\fB\-M\fR, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually
\fB\-M\fR
only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
\fI<n>\fR
controls this aspect of the
\fB\-B\fR
option (defaults to 50%)\&.
\fB\-B20%\fR
specifies that a change with addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file\(cqs size are eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another file\&.
.RE

Detect renames\&. If
\fI<n>\fR
is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i\&.e\&. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file\(cqs size)\&. For example,
\fB\-M90%\fR
means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn\(cqt changed\&. Without a
\fB%\fR
sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it\&. I\&.e\&.,
\fB\-M5\fR
becomes 0\&.5, and is thus the same as
\fB\-M50%\fR\&. Similarly,

Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \fB\-\fR (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), \fB+\fR (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or " " (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&...\: with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\&. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\(cqs line is different from it\&.
.sp
A \fB\-\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\&. A \fB+\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\&.
.sp
In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \fB\-\fR removals from both file1 and file2, plus \fB++\fR to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or file2)\&. Also, eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with \fB+\fR)\&.
.sp
When shown by \fBgit\fR \fBdiff\-tree\fR \fB\-c\fR, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i\&.e\&. file1\&.\&.fileN are the parents)\&. When shown by \fBgit\fR \fBdiff\-files\fR \fB\-c\fR, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file (i\&.e\&. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their version")\&.
.SH "OTHER DIFF FORMATS"

The \fB\-\-summary\fR option describes newly added, deleted, renamed and copied files\&. The \fB\-\-stat\fR option adds \fBdiffstat\fR(1) graph to the output\&. These options can be combined with other options, such as \fB\-p\fR, and are meant for human consumption\&.
.sp
When showing a change that involves a rename or a copy, \fB\-\-stat\fR output formats the pathnames compactly by combining common prefix and suffix of the pathnames\&. For example, a change that moves \fBarch/i386/Makefile\fR to \fBarch/x86/Makefile\fR while modifying 4 lines will be shown like this:

The extra \fBNUL\fR before the preimage path in renamed case is to allow scripts that read the output to tell if the current record being read is a single\-path record or a rename/copy record without reading ahead\&. After reading added and deleted lines, reading up to \fBNUL\fR would yield the pathname, but if that is \fBNUL\fR, the record will show two paths\&.

\fBdiff\&.autoRefreshIndex\fR

\fBdiff\&.dirstat\fR

A comma separated list of

option to

\fBdiff\fR

\fB\-\-dirstat=\fR\fI<param>\fR\fB,\fR\&.\&.\&.)\&. The fallback defaults (when not changed by
\fBdiff\&.dirstat\fR) are
\fBchanges\fR,noncumulative,3\&. The following parameters are available:
.PP
\fBchanges\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed from the source, or added to the destination\&. This ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file\&. In other words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes\&. This is the default behavior when no parameter is given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlines\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line\-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts\&. (For binary files, count 64\-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept of lines)\&. This is a more expensive
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
behavior than the
\fBchanges\fR
behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as much as other changes\&. The resulting output is consistent with what you get from the other
\fB\-\-*stat\fR
options\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfiles\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed\&. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis\&. This is the computationally cheapest
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
behavior, since it does not have to look at the file contents at all\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcumulative\fR
.RS 4
Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well\&. Note that when using
\fBcumulative\fR, the sum of the percentages reported may exceed 100%\&. The default (non\-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
\fBnoncumulative\fR
parameter\&.
.RE

\fI<limit>\fR

An integer parameter specifies a cut\-off percent (3% by default)\&. Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are not shown in the output\&.
