.SH "NAME"
git-diff - Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIgit diff\fR [<common diff options>] <commit>{0,2} [\-\-] [<path>\&...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Show changes between two trees, a tree and the working tree, a tree and the index file, or the index file and the working tree\.
.PP
\fIgit diff\fR [\-\-options] [\-\-] [<path>\&...]
.RS 4
This form is to view the changes you made relative to the index (staging area for the next commit)\. In other words, the differences are what you _could_ tell git to further add to the index but you still haven\'t\. You can stage these changes by using \fBgit-add\fR(1)\.

If exactly two paths are given, and at least one is untracked, compare the two files / directories\. This behavior can be forced by \-\-no\-index\.
.RE
.PP
\fIgit diff\fR [\-\-options] \-\-cached [<commit>] [\-\-] [<path>\&...]
.RS 4
This form is to view the changes you staged for the next commit relative to the named <commit>\. Typically you would want comparison with the latest commit, so if you do not give <commit>, it defaults to HEAD\.
.RE
.PP
\fIgit diff\fR [\-\-options] <commit> [\-\-] [<path>\&...]
.RS 4
This form is to view the changes you have in your working tree relative to the named <commit>\. You can use HEAD to compare it with the latest commit, or a branch name to compare with the tip of a different branch\.
.RE
.PP
\fIgit diff\fR [\-\-options] <commit> <commit> [\-\-] [<path>\&...]
.RS 4
This is to view the changes between two arbitrary <commit>\.
.RE
.PP
\fIgit diff\fR [\-\-options] <commit>\.\.<commit> [\-\-] [<path>\&...]
.RS 4
This is synonymous to the previous form\. If <commit> on one side is omitted, it will have the same effect as using HEAD instead\.
.RE
.PP
\fIgit diff\fR [\-\-options] <commit>\.\.\.<commit> [\-\-] [<path>\&...]
.RS 4
This form is to view the changes on the branch containing and up to the second <commit>, starting at a common ancestor of both <commit>\. "git diff A\.\.\.B" is equivalent to "git diff $(git\-merge\-base A B) B"\. You can omit any one of <commit>, which has the same effect as using HEAD instead\.
.RE
Just in case if you are doing something exotic, it should be noted that all of the <commit> in the above description, except for the last two forms that use "\.\." notations, can be any <tree\-ish>\.

For a more complete list of ways to spell <commit>, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in \fBgit-rev-parse\fR(1)\. However, "diff" is about comparing two _endpoints_, not ranges, and the range notations ("<commit>\.\.<commit>" and "<commit>\.\.\.<commit>") do not mean a range as defined in the "SPECIFYING RANGES" section in \fBgit-rev-parse\fR(1)\.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.RE
.PP
\-\-numstat
.RS 4
Similar to \-\-stat, but shows number of added and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly\. For binary files, outputs two \- instead of saying 0 0\.

.RE
.PP
\-\-dirstat[=limit]
.RS 4
Output the distribution of relative amount of changes (number of lines added or removed) for each sub\-directory\. Directories with changes below a cut\-off percent (3% by default) are not shown\. The cut\-off percent can be set with "\-\-dirstat=limit"\. Changes in a child directory is not counted for the parent directory, unless "\-\-cumulative" is used\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dirstat\-by\-file[=limit]
.RS 4
Same as \-\-dirstat, but counts changed files instead of lines\.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
Show only names of changed files\.
.RE
.PP

Show only names and status of changed files\. See the description of the \-\-diff\-filter option on what the status letters mean\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-index
.RS 4
Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full pre\- and post\-image blob object names on the "index" line when generating patch format output\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-binary
.RS 4
In addition to \-\-full\-index, output "binary diff" that can be applied with "git apply"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev[=<n>]
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal object name in diff\-raw format output and diff\-tree header lines, show only handful hexdigits prefix\. This is independent of \-\-full\-index option above, which controls the diff\-patch output format\. Non default number of digits can be specified with \-\-abbrev=<n>\.
.RE
.PP
\-B
.RS 4
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create\.
.RE
.PP
\-M
.RS 4
Detect renames\.
.RE
.PP
\-C
.RS 4
Detect copies as well as renames\. See also \-\-find\-copies\-harder\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-diff\-filter=[ACDMRTUXB*]
.RS 4
Select only files that are Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted (D), Modified (M), Renamed (R), have their type (i\.e\. regular file, symlink, submodule, \&...) changed (T), are Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have had their pairing Broken (B)\. Any combination of the filter characters may be used\. When * (All\-or\-none) is added to the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that matches other criteria, nothing is selected\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-find\-copies\-harder
.RS 4
For performance reasons, by default, \-C option finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset\. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy\. This is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it with caution\. Giving more than one \-C option has the same effect\.
.RE
.PP
\-l<num>
.RS 4
\-M and \-C options require O(n^2) processing time where n is the number of potential rename/copy targets\. This option prevents rename/copy detection from running if the number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified number\.
.RE
.PP
\-S<string>
.RS 4
Look for differences that contain the change in <string>\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pickaxe\-all
.RS 4
When \-S finds a change, show all the changes in that changeset, not just the files that contain the change in <string>\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pickaxe\-regex
.RS 4
Make the <string> not a plain string but an extended POSIX regex to match\.
.RE
.PP
\-O<orderfile>
.RS 4
Output the patch in the order specified in the <orderfile>, which has one shell glob pattern per line\.
.RE
.PP
\-R
.RS 4
Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or on\-disk file to tree contents\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-relative[=<path>]
.RS 4
When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told to exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to it with this option\. When you are not in a subdirectory (e\.g\. in a bare repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative to by giving a <path> as an argument\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-text
.RS 4
Treat all files as text\.
.RE
.PP
\-a
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-text"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-space\-at\-eol
.RS 4
Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-space\-change
.RS 4
Ignore changes in amount of whitespace\. This ignores whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent\.
.RE
.PP
\-b
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-ignore\-space\-change"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-all\-space
.RS 4
Ignore whitespace when comparing lines\. This ignores differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has none\.
.RE
.PP
\-w
.RS 4
Shorthand for "\-\-ignore\-all\-space"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exit\-code
.RS 4
Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1)\. That is, it exits with 1 if there were differences and 0 means no differences\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-quiet
.RS 4
Disable all output of the program\. Implies \-\-exit\-code\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ext\-diff
.RS 4
Allow an external diff helper to be executed\. If you set an external diff driver with \fBgitattributes\fR(5), you need to use this option with \fBgit-log\fR(1) and friends\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-ext\-diff
.RS 4
Disallow external diff drivers\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-submodules
.RS 4
Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-src\-prefix=<prefix>
.RS 4
Show the given source prefix instead of "a/"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dst\-prefix=<prefix>
.RS 4
Show the given destination prefix instead of "b/"\.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-prefix
.RS 4
Do not show any source or destination prefix\.
.RE
For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also \fBgitdiffcore\fR(7)\.
.PP
<path>\&...
.RS 4
The <paths> parameters, when given, are used to limit the diff to the named paths (you can give directory names and get diff for all files under them)\.
.RE
.SH "OUTPUT FORMAT"
The output format from "git\-diff\-index", "git\-diff\-tree", "git\-diff\-files" and "git diff \-\-raw" are very similar\.

These commands all compare two sets of things; what is compared differs:
.PP
git\-diff\-index <tree\-ish>
.RS 4
compares the <tree\-ish> and the files on the filesystem\.
.RE
.PP
git\-diff\-index \-\-cached <tree\-ish>
.RS 4
compares the <tree\-ish> and the index\.
.RE
.PP
git\-diff\-tree [\-r] <tree\-ish\-1> <tree\-ish\-2> [<pattern>\&...]
.RS 4
compares the trees named by the two arguments\.
.RE
.PP
git\-diff\-files [<pattern>\&...]
.RS 4
compares the index and the files on the filesystem\.

.SH "GENERATING PATCHES WITH -P"
When "git\-diff\-index", "git\-diff\-tree", or "git\-diff\-files" are run with a \fI\-p\fR option, "git diff" without the \fI\-\-raw\fR option, or "git log" with the "\-p" option, they do not produce the output described above; instead they produce a patch file\. You can customize the creation of such patches via the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment variables\.

What the \-p option produces is slightly different from the traditional diff format\.

.RE
The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines\. It is a rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign\. The similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no line from the old file made it into the new one\.

Similar to two\-line header for traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, /dev/null is used to signal created or deleted files\.

.RS 4
\h'-04' 4.\h'+02'Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to patch \-p1\. Combined diff format was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant for apply\. The change is similar to the change in the extended \fIindex\fR header:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf
@@@ <from\-file\-range> <from\-file\-range> <to\-file\-range> @@@
.fi
.RE
There are (number of parents + 1) @ characters in the chunk header for combined diff format\.
.RE
Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \- (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), + (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or " " (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\'s line is different from it\.

A \- character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\. A + character in the column N means that the line appears in the last file, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\.

In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \- removals from both file1 and file2, plus ++ to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 nor file2)\. Also two other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with +)\.

When shown by git diff\-tree \-c, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i\.e\. file1\.\.fileN are the parents)\. When shown by git diff\-files \-c, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file (i\.e\. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their version")\.
.SH "OTHER DIFF FORMATS"
The \-\-summary option describes newly added, deleted, renamed and copied files\. The \-\-stat option adds diffstat(1) graph to the output\. These options can be combined with other options, such as \-p, and are meant for human consumption\.

When showing a change that involves a rename or a copy, \-\-stat output formats the pathnames compactly by combining common prefix and suffix of the pathnames\. For example, a change that moves arch/i386/Makefile to arch/x86/Makefile while modifying 4 lines will be shown like this:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf

\.ft C
arch/{i386 => x86}/Makefile    |   4 +\-\-

The extra NUL before the preimage path in renamed case is to allow scripts that read the output to tell if the current record being read is a single\-path record or a rename/copy record without reading ahead\. After reading added and deleted lines, reading up to NUL would yield the pathname, but if that is NUL, the record will show two paths\.
