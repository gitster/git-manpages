.SH "NAME"
git-status \- Show the working tree status
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fIgit status\fR [<options>\&...] [\-\-] [<pathspec>\&...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by git (and are not ignored by \fBgitignore\fR(5))\&. The first are what you \fIwould\fR commit by running git commit; the second and third are what you \fIcould\fR commit by running \fIgit add\fR before running git commit\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-s, \-\-short
.RS 4
Give the output in the short\-format\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b, \-\-branch
.RS 4
Show the branch and tracking info even in short\-format\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-porcelain
.RS 4
Give the output in a stable, easy\-to\-parse format for scripts\&. Currently this is identical to \-\-short output, but is guaranteed not to change in the future, making it safe for scripts\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u[<mode>], \-\-untracked\-files[=<mode>]
.RS 4
Show untracked files\&.
.sp
The mode parameter is optional (defaults to
\fIall\fR), and is used to specify the handling of untracked files; when \-u is not used, the default is
\fInormal\fR, i\&.e\&. show untracked files and directories\&.
.sp
The possible options are:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}

\fIno\fR
\- Show no untracked files
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}

\fInormal\fR
\- Shows untracked files and directories
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}

\fIall\fR
\- Also shows individual files in untracked directories\&.
.sp
The default can be changed using the status\&.showUntrackedFiles configuration variable documented in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-submodules[=<when>]
.RS 4
Ignore changes to submodules when looking for changes\&. <when> can be either "none", "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is the default\&. Using "none" will consider the submodule modified when it either contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the
\fIignore\fR
option in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
or
\fBgitmodules\fR(5)\&. When "untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified content)\&. Using "dirty" ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown (this was the behavior before 1\&.7\&.0)\&. Using "all" hides all changes to submodules (and suppresses the output of submodule summaries when the config option
status\&.submodulesummary
is set)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-z
.RS 4
Terminate entries with NUL, instead of LF\&. This implies the
\-\-porcelain
output format if no other format is given\&.
.RE
.SH "OUTPUT"
.sp
The output from this command is designed to be used as a commit template comment, and all the output lines are prefixed with \fI#\fR\&. The default, long format, is designed to be human readable, verbose and descriptive\&. They are subject to change in any time\&.
.sp
The paths mentioned in the output, unlike many other git commands, are made relative to the current directory if you are working in a subdirectory (this is on purpose, to help cutting and pasting)\&. See the status\&.relativePaths config option below\&.
.sp
In short\-format, the status of each path is shown as
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
XY PATH1 \-> PATH2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
where PATH1 is the path in the HEAD, and ` \(-> PATH2` part is shown only when PATH1 corresponds to a different path in the index/worktree (i\&.e\&. the file is renamed)\&. The \fIXY\fR is a two\-letter status code\&.
.sp
The fields (including the \(->) are separated from each other by a single space\&. If a filename contains whitespace or other nonprintable characters, that field will be quoted in the manner of a C string literal: surrounded by ASCII double quote (34) characters, and with interior special characters backslash\-escaped\&.
.sp
For paths with merge conflicts, X and \fIY\fR show the modification states of each side of the merge\&. For paths that do not have merge conflicts, X shows the status of the index, and Y shows the status of the work tree\&. For untracked paths, XY are ??\&. Other status codes can be interpreted as follows:

.sp
If \-b is used the short\-format status is preceded by a line
.sp
## branchname tracking info
.sp
There is an alternate \-z format recommended for machine parsing\&. In that format, the status field is the same, but some other things change\&. First, the \fI\(->\fR is omitted from rename entries and the field order is reversed (e\&.g \fIfrom \(-> to\fR becomes \fIto from\fR)\&. Second, a NUL (ASCII 0) follows each filename, replacing space as a field separator and the terminating newline (but a space still separates the status field from the first filename)\&. Third, filenames containing special characters are not specially formatted; no quoting or backslash\-escaping is performed\&. Fourth, there is no branch line\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
The command honors color\&.status (or status\&.color \(em they mean the same thing and the latter is kept for backward compatibility) and color\&.status\&.<slot> configuration variables to colorize its output\&.
.sp
If the config variable status\&.relativePaths is set to false, then all paths shown are relative to the repository root, not to the current directory\&.
.sp
If status\&.submodulesummary is set to a non zero number or true (identical to \-1 or an unlimited number), the submodule summary will be enabled for the long format and a summary of commits for modified submodules will be shown (see \-\-summary\-limit option of \fBgit-submodule\fR(1))\&.
