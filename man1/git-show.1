.SH "NAME"
git-show \- Show various types of objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit show\fR [<options>] [<object>\&...]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits)\&.
.sp
For commits it shows the log message and textual diff\&. It also presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by \fIgit diff\-tree \-\-cc\fR\&.
.sp
For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects\&.
.sp
For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to \fIgit ls\-tree\fR with \-\-name\-only)\&.
.sp
For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents\&.
.sp
Some options that \fIgit log\fR command understands can be used to control how the changes the commit introduces are shown\&.
.sp
This manual page describes only the most frequently used options\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
<object>\&...
.RS 4
The names of objects to show (defaults to
\fIHEAD\fR)\&. For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pretty[=<format>], \-\-format=<format>
.RS 4
Pretty\-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where
\fI<format>\fR
can be one of
\fIoneline\fR,
\fIshort\fR,
\fImedium\fR,
\fIfull\fR,
\fIfuller\fR,
\fIreference\fR,
\fIemail\fR,
\fIraw\fR,
\fIformat:<string>\fR
and
\fItformat:<string>\fR\&. When
\fI<format>\fR
is none of the above, and has
\fI%placeholder\fR
in it, it acts as if
\fI\-\-pretty=tformat:<format>\fR
were given\&.
.sp
See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section for some additional details for each format\&. When
\fI=<format>\fR
part is omitted, it defaults to
\fImedium\fR\&.
.sp
Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository configuration (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev\-commit
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal commit object name, show a prefix that names the object uniquely\&. "\-\-abbrev=<n>" (which also modifies diff output, if it is displayed) option can be used to specify the minimum length of the prefix\&.
.sp
This should make "\-\-pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for people using 80\-column terminals\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-abbrev\-commit
.RS 4
Show the full 40\-byte hexadecimal commit object name\&. This negates
\fB\-\-abbrev\-commit\fR, either explicit or implied by other options such as "\-\-oneline"\&. It also overrides the
\fBlog\&.abbrevCommit\fR
variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-oneline
.RS 4
This is a shorthand for "\-\-pretty=oneline \-\-abbrev\-commit" used together\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-encoding=<encoding>
.RS 4
Commit objects record the character encoding used for the log message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to re\-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user\&. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF\-8\&. Note that if an object claims to be encoded in
\fBX\fR
and we are outputting in
\fBX\fR, we will output the object verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the original commit may be copied to the output\&. Likewise, if iconv(3) fails to convert the commit, we will quietly output the original object verbatim\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-expand\-tabs=<n>, \-\-expand\-tabs, \-\-no\-expand\-tabs
.RS 4
Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough spaces to fill to the next display column that is a multiple of
\fI<n>\fR) in the log message before showing it in the output\&.
\fB\-\-expand\-tabs\fR
is a short\-hand for
\fB\-\-expand\-tabs=8\fR, and
\fB\-\-no\-expand\-tabs\fR
is a short\-hand for
\fB\-\-expand\-tabs=0\fR, which disables tab expansion\&.
.sp
By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent the log message by 4 spaces (i\&.e\&.
\fImedium\fR, which is the default,
\fIfull\fR, and
\fIfuller\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-notes[=<ref>]
.RS 4
Show the notes (see
\fBgit-notes\fR(1)) that annotate the commit, when showing the commit log message\&. This is the default for
\fBgit log\fR,
\fBgit show\fR
and
\fBgit whatchanged\fR
commands when there is no
\fB\-\-pretty\fR,
\fB\-\-format\fR, or
\fB\-\-oneline\fR
option given on the command line\&.
.sp
By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
\fBcore\&.notesRef\fR
and
\fBnotes\&.displayRef\fR
variables (or corresponding environment overrides)\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
for more details\&.
.sp
With an optional
\fI<ref>\fR
argument, use the ref to find the notes to display\&. The ref can specify the full refname when it begins with
\fBrefs/notes/\fR; when it begins with
\fBnotes/\fR,
\fBrefs/\fR
and otherwise
\fBrefs/notes/\fR
is prefixed to form the full name of the ref\&.
.sp
Multiple \-\-notes options can be combined to control which notes are being displayed\&. Examples: "\-\-notes=foo" will show only notes from "refs/notes/foo"; "\-\-notes=foo \-\-notes" will show both notes from "refs/notes/foo" and from the default notes ref(s)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-notes
.RS 4
Do not show notes\&. This negates the above
\fB\-\-notes\fR
option, by resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown\&. Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e\&.g\&. "\-\-notes \-\-notes=foo \-\-no\-notes \-\-notes=bar" will only show notes from "refs/notes/bar"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-notes\-by\-default
.RS 4
Show the default notes unless options for displaying specific notes are given\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-notes[=<ref>], \-\-[no\-]standard\-notes
.RS 4
These options are deprecated\&. Use the above \-\-notes/\-\-no\-notes options instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-signature
.RS 4
Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the signature to
\fBgpg \-\-verify\fR
and show the output\&.
.RE
.SH "PRETTY FORMATS"
.sp
If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty\-format is not \fIoneline\fR, \fIemail\fR or \fIraw\fR, an additional line is inserted before the \fIAuthor:\fR line\&. This line begins with "Merge: " and the hashes of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces\&. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the \fBdirect\fR parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file\&.
.sp
There are several built\-in formats, and you can define additional formats by setting a pretty\&.<name> config option to either another format name, or a \fIformat:\fR string, as described below (see \fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. Here are the details of the built\-in formats:
.sp

This format is used to refer to another commit in a commit message and is the same as
\fB\-\-pretty=\*(Aqformat:%C(auto)%h (%s, %ad)\*(Aq\fR\&. By default, the date is formatted with
\fB\-\-date=short\fR
unless another
\fB\-\-date\fR
option is explicitly specified\&. As with any
\fBformat:\fR
with format placeholders, its output is not affected by other options like
\fB\-\-decorate\fR
and
\fB\-\-walk\-reflogs\fR\&.

\fIraw\fR
.sp
The
\fIraw\fR
format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit object\&. Notably, the hashes are displayed in full, regardless of whether \-\-abbrev or \-\-no\-abbrev are used, and
\fIparents\fR
information show the true parent commits, without taking grafts or history simplification into account\&. Note that this format affects the way commits are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e\&.g\&. with
\fBgit log \-\-raw\fR\&. To get full object names in a raw diff format, use
\fB\-\-no\-abbrev\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fIformat:<format\-string>\fR
.sp
The
\fIformat:<format\-string>\fR
format allows you to specify which information you want to show\&. It works a little bit like printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with
\fI%n\fR
instead of
\fI\en\fR\&.
.sp
E\&.g,
\fIformat:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"\fR
would show something like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
The title was >>t4119: test autocomputing \-p<n> for traditional diff input\&.<<

\fB\-\-color\fR, and respecting the
\fBauto\fR
settings of the former if we are going to a terminal)\&.
\fB%C(auto,\&.\&.\&.)\fR

\fItformat:\fR
.sp
The
\fItformat:\fR
format works exactly like
\fIformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\&. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\&. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \e
  | perl \-pe \*(Aq$_ \&.= " \-\- NO NEWLINE\en" unless /\en/\*(Aq

4da45be

.fi
.if n \{\

Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line\-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts\&. (For binary files, count 64\-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept of lines)\&. This is a more expensive
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR

\-B[<n>][/<m>], \-\-break\-rewrites[=[<n>][/<m>]]
.RS 4
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create\&. This serves two purposes:
.sp
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
\fBm\fR
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 60%)\&.
\fB\-B/70%\fR
specifies that less than 30% of the original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i\&.e\&. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines)\&.
.sp
When used with \-M, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually \-M only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
\fBn\fR
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 50%)\&.
\fB\-B20%\fR
specifies that a change with addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file\(cqs size are eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another file\&.
.RE

.RS 4
If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit\&. For following files across renames while traversing history, see
\fB\-\-follow\fR\&. If
\fBn\fR
is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i\&.e\&. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file\(cqs size)\&. For example,
\fB\-M90%\fR
means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn\(cqt changed\&. Without a
\fB%\fR
sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it\&. I\&.e\&.,
\fB\-M5\fR

\fB\-M50%\fR\&. Similarly,

Any diff\-generating command can take the \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-cc\fR option to produce a \fIcombined diff\fR when showing a merge\&. This is the default format when showing merges with \fBgit-diff\fR(1) or \fBgit-show\fR(1)\&. Note also that you can give suitable \fB\-\-diff\-merges\fR option to any of these commands to force generation of diffs in a specific format\&.

The
\fBmode <mode>,<mode>\&.\&.<mode>\fR

Similar to the two\-line header for the traditional

diff format,
\fB/dev/null\fR
is used to signal created or deleted files\&.
.sp
However, if the \-\-combined\-all\-paths option is provided, instead of a two\-line from\-file/to\-file, you get an N+1 line from\-file/to\-file header, where N is the number of parents in the merge commit:
.sp
.if n \{\

.\}
.nf
\-\-\- a/file
\-\-\- a/file
\-\-\- a/file
+++ b/file
.fi
.if n \{\

This extended format can be useful if rename or copy detection is active, to allow you to see the original name of the file in different parents\&.

Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to
\fBpatch \-p1\fR\&. Combined diff format was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant to be applied\&. The change is similar to the change in the extended
\fIindex\fR
header:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
@@@ <from\-file\-range> <from\-file\-range> <to\-file\-range> @@@
.fi
.if n \{\

There are (number of parents + 1)
\fB@\fR
characters in the chunk header for combined diff format\&.
.RE
.sp
Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \fB\-\fR (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), \fB+\fR (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or \fB" "\fR (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\&. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\(cqs line is different from it\&.
.sp
A \fB\-\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\&. A \fB+\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\&.
.sp
In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \fB\-\fR removals from both file1 and file2, plus \fB++\fR to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or file2)\&. Also, eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with \fB+\fR)\&.
.sp
When shown by \fBgit diff\-tree \-c\fR, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i\&.e\&. file1\&.\&.fileN are the parents)\&. When shown by \fBgit diff\-files \-c\fR, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file (i\&.e\&. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their version")\&.

Path names are encoded in UTF\-8 normalization form C\&. This applies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as path names in command line arguments, environment variables and config files (\fB\&.git/config\fR

\fBgit-config\fR(1)),
\fBgitignore\fR(5),

\fBgitmodules\fR(5))\&.
.sp
Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of non\-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions (except on Mac and Windows)\&. Therefore, using non\-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended ASCII encodings\&. However, repositories created on such systems will not work properly on UTF\-8\-based systems (e\&.g\&. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa\&. Additionally, many Git\-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF\-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly\&.

Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF\-8, but other extended ASCII encodings are also supported\&. This includes ISO\-8859\-x, CP125x and many others, but

Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF\-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF\-8 on projects\&. If all participants of a particular project find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it\&. However, there are a few things to keep in mind\&.

\fIgit commit\fR
and
\fIgit commit\-tree\fR
issue a warning if the commit log message given to it does not look like a valid UTF\-8 string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding\&. The way to say this is to have
\fBi18n\&.commitEncoding\fR
in
\fB\&.git/config\fR
file, like this:

Note that we deliberately chose not to re\-code the commit log message when a commit is made to force UTF\-8 at the commit object level, because re\-coding to UTF\-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation\&.
