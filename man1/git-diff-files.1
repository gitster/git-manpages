.SH "NAME"
git-diff-files \- Compares files in the working tree and the index
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit diff\-files\fR [\-q] [\-0 | \-1 | \-2 | \-3 | \-c | \-\-cc] [<common\-diff\-options>] [<path>\&...]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Compares the files in the working tree and the index\&. When paths are specified, compares only those named paths\&. Otherwise all entries in the index are compared\&. The output format is the same as for \fIgit diff\-index\fR and \fIgit diff\-tree\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-p, \-u, \-\-patch
.RS 4
Generate patch (see
the section called \(lqGENERATING PATCH TEXT WITH \-P\(rq)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s, \-\-no\-patch
.RS 4
Suppress all output from the diff machinery\&. Useful for commands like
\fBgit show\fR
that show the patch by default to squelch their output, or to cancel the effect of options like
\fB\-\-patch\fR,
\fB\-\-stat\fR
earlier on the command line in an alias\&.
.RE
.PP
\-U<n>, \-\-unified=<n>
.RS 4
Generate diffs with <n> lines of context instead of the usual three\&. Implies
\fB\-\-patch\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-output=<file>
.RS 4
Output to a specific file instead of stdout\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-output\-indicator\-new=<char>, \-\-output\-indicator\-old=<char>, \-\-output\-indicator\-context=<char>
.RS 4
Specify the character used to indicate new, old or context lines in the generated patch\&. Normally they are
\fI+\fR,
\fI\-\fR
and \*(Aq \*(Aq respectively\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-raw
.RS 4
Generate the diff in raw format\&. This is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-patch\-with\-raw
.RS 4
Synonym for
\fB\-p \-\-raw\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-indent\-heuristic
.RS 4
Enable the heuristic that shifts diff hunk boundaries to make patches easier to read\&. This is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-indent\-heuristic
.RS 4
Disable the indent heuristic\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-minimal
.RS 4
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-patience
.RS 4
Generate a diff using the "patience diff" algorithm\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-histogram
.RS 4
Generate a diff using the "histogram diff" algorithm\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-anchored=<text>
.RS 4
Generate a diff using the "anchored diff" algorithm\&.
.sp
This option may be specified more than once\&.
.sp
If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only once, and starts with this text, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from appearing as a deletion or addition in the output\&. It uses the "patience diff" algorithm internally\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-diff\-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}
.RS 4
Choose a diff algorithm\&. The variants are as follows:
.PP
\fBdefault\fR, \fBmyers\fR
.RS 4
The basic greedy diff algorithm\&. Currently, this is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBminimal\fR
.RS 4
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpatience\fR
.RS 4
Use "patience diff" algorithm when generating patches\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhistogram\fR
.RS 4
This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to "support low\-occurrence common elements"\&.
.RE
.sp
For instance, if you configured the
\fBdiff\&.algorithm\fR
variable to a non\-default value and want to use the default one, then you have to use
\fB\-\-diff\-algorithm=default\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stat[=<width>[,<name\-width>[,<count>]]]
.RS 4
Generate a diffstat\&. By default, as much space as necessary will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part\&. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a terminal, and can be overridden by
\fB<width>\fR\&. The width of the filename part can be limited by giving another width
\fB<name\-width>\fR
after a comma or by setting
\fBdiff\&.statNameWidth=<width>\fR\&. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
\fB\-\-stat\-graph\-width=<width>\fR
or by setting
\fBdiff\&.statGraphWidth=<width>\fR\&. Using
\fB\-\-stat\fR
or
\fB\-\-stat\-graph\-width\fR
affects all commands generating a stat graph, while setting
\fBdiff\&.statNameWidth\fR
or
\fBdiff\&.statGraphWidth\fR
does not affect
\fBgit format\-patch\fR\&. By giving a third parameter
\fB<count>\fR, you can limit the output to the first
\fB<count>\fR
lines, followed by
\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR
if there are more\&.
.sp
These parameters can also be set individually with
\fB\-\-stat\-width=<width>\fR,
\fB\-\-stat\-name\-width=<name\-width>\fR
and
\fB\-\-stat\-count=<count>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-compact\-summary
.RS 4
Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as file creations or deletions ("new" or "gone", optionally "+l" if it\(cqs a symlink) and mode changes ("+x" or "\-x" for adding or removing executable bit respectively) in diffstat\&. The information is put between the filename part and the graph part\&. Implies
\fB\-\-stat\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-numstat
.RS 4
Similar to
\fB\-\-stat\fR, but shows number of added and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly\&. For binary files, outputs two
\fB\-\fR
instead of saying
\fB0 0\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-shortstat
.RS 4
Output only the last line of the
\fB\-\-stat\fR
format containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\-X[<param1,param2,\&...>], \-\-dirstat[=<param1,param2,\&...>]
.RS 4
Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each sub\-directory\&. The behavior of
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
can be customized by passing it a comma separated list of parameters\&. The defaults are controlled by the
\fBdiff\&.dirstat\fR
configuration variable (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. The following parameters are available:
.PP
\fBchanges\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed from the source, or added to the destination\&. This ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file\&. In other words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes\&. This is the default behavior when no parameter is given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlines\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line\-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts\&. (For binary files, count 64\-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept of lines)\&. This is a more expensive
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
behavior than the
\fBchanges\fR
behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as much as other changes\&. The resulting output is consistent with what you get from the other
\fB\-\-*stat\fR
options\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfiles\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed\&. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis\&. This is the computationally cheapest
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
behavior, since it does not have to look at the file contents at all\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcumulative\fR
.RS 4
Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well\&. Note that when using
\fBcumulative\fR, the sum of the percentages reported may exceed 100%\&. The default (non\-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
\fBnoncumulative\fR
parameter\&.
.RE
.PP
<limit>
.RS 4
An integer parameter specifies a cut\-off percent (3% by default)\&. Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are not shown in the output\&.
.RE
.sp
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
\fB\-\-dirstat=files,10,cumulative\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cumulative
.RS 4
Synonym for \-\-dirstat=cumulative
.RE
.PP
\-\-dirstat\-by\-file[=<param1,param2>\&...]
.RS 4
Synonym for \-\-dirstat=files,<param1>,<param2>\&...
.RE
.PP
\-\-summary
.RS 4
Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as creations, renames and mode changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-patch\-with\-stat
.RS 4
Synonym for
\fB\-p \-\-stat\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-z
.RS 4
When
\fB\-\-raw\fR,
\fB\-\-numstat\fR,
\fB\-\-name\-only\fR
or
\fB\-\-name\-status\fR
has been given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators\&.
.sp
Without this option, pathnames with "unusual" characters are quoted as explained for the configuration variable
\fBcore\&.quotePath\fR
(see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-name\-only
.RS 4
Show only the name of each changed file in the post\-image tree\&. The file names are often encoded in UTF\-8\&. For more information see the discussion about encoding in the
\fBgit-log\fR(1)
manual page\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-name\-status
.RS 4
Show only the name(s) and status of each changed file\&. See the description of the
\fB\-\-diff\-filter\fR
option on what the status letters mean\&. Just like
\fB\-\-name\-only\fR
the file names are often encoded in UTF\-8\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-submodule[=<format>]
.RS 4
Specify how differences in submodules are shown\&. When specifying
\fB\-\-submodule=short\fR
the
\fIshort\fR
format is used\&. This format just shows the names of the commits at the beginning and end of the range\&. When
\fB\-\-submodule\fR
or
\fB\-\-submodule=log\fR
is specified, the
\fIlog\fR
format is used\&. This format lists the commits in the range like
\fBgit-submodule\fR(1)
\fBsummary\fR
does\&. When
\fB\-\-submodule=diff\fR
is specified, the
\fIdiff\fR
format is used\&. This format shows an inline diff of the changes in the submodule contents between the commit range\&. Defaults to
\fBdiff\&.submodule\fR
or the
\fIshort\fR
format if the config option is unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color[=<when>]
.RS 4
Show colored diff\&.
\fB\-\-color\fR
(i\&.e\&. without
\fI=<when>\fR) is the same as
\fB\-\-color=always\fR\&.
\fI<when>\fR
can be one of
\fBalways\fR,
\fBnever\fR, or
\fBauto\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-color
.RS 4
Turn off colored diff\&. It is the same as
\fB\-\-color=never\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color\-moved[=<mode>]
.RS 4
Moved lines of code are colored differently\&. The <mode> defaults to
\fIno\fR
if the option is not given and to
\fIzebra\fR
if the option with no mode is given\&. The mode must be one of:
.PP
no
.RS 4
Moved lines are not highlighted\&.
.RE
.PP
default
.RS 4
Is a synonym for
\fBzebra\fR\&. This may change to a more sensible mode in the future\&.
.RE
.PP
plain
.RS 4
Any line that is added in one location and was removed in another location will be colored with
\fIcolor\&.diff\&.newMoved\fR\&. Similarly
\fIcolor\&.diff\&.oldMoved\fR
will be used for removed lines that are added somewhere else in the diff\&. This mode picks up any moved line, but it is not very useful in a review to determine if a block of code was moved without permutation\&.
.RE
.PP
blocks
.RS 4
Blocks of moved text of at least 20 alphanumeric characters are detected greedily\&. The detected blocks are painted using either the
\fIcolor\&.diff\&.{old,new}Moved\fR
color\&. Adjacent blocks cannot be told apart\&.
.RE
.PP
zebra
.RS 4
Blocks of moved text are detected as in
\fIblocks\fR
mode\&. The blocks are painted using either the
\fIcolor\&.diff\&.{old,new}Moved\fR
color or
\fIcolor\&.diff\&.{old,new}MovedAlternative\fR\&. The change between the two colors indicates that a new block was detected\&.
.RE
.PP
dimmed\-zebra
.RS 4
Similar to
\fIzebra\fR, but additional dimming of uninteresting parts of moved code is performed\&. The bordering lines of two adjacent blocks are considered interesting, the rest is uninteresting\&.
\fBdimmed_zebra\fR
is a deprecated synonym\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-color\-moved
.RS 4
Turn off move detection\&. This can be used to override configuration settings\&. It is the same as
\fB\-\-color\-moved=no\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color\-moved\-ws=<modes>
.RS 4
This configures how whitespace is ignored when performing the move detection for
\fB\-\-color\-moved\fR\&. These modes can be given as a comma separated list:
.PP
no
.RS 4
Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection\&.
.RE
.PP
ignore\-space\-at\-eol
.RS 4
Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL\&.
.RE
.PP
ignore\-space\-change
.RS 4
Ignore changes in amount of whitespace\&. This ignores whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent\&.
.RE
.PP
ignore\-all\-space
.RS 4
Ignore whitespace when comparing lines\&. This ignores differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has none\&.
.RE
.PP
allow\-indentation\-change
.RS 4
Initially ignore any whitespace in the move detection, then group the moved code blocks only into a block if the change in whitespace is the same per line\&. This is incompatible with the other modes\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-color\-moved\-ws
.RS 4
Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection\&. This can be used to override configuration settings\&. It is the same as
\fB\-\-color\-moved\-ws=no\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-word\-diff[=<mode>]
.RS 4
Show a word diff, using the <mode> to delimit changed words\&. By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see
\fB\-\-word\-diff\-regex\fR
below\&. The <mode> defaults to
\fIplain\fR, and must be one of:
.PP
color
.RS 4
Highlight changed words using only colors\&. Implies
\fB\-\-color\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
plain
.RS 4
Show words as
\fB[\-removed\-]\fR
and
\fB{+added+}\fR\&. Makes no attempts to escape the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the output may be ambiguous\&.
.RE
.PP
porcelain
.RS 4
Use a special line\-based format intended for script consumption\&. Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the usual unified diff format, starting with a
\fB+\fR/\fB\-\fR/` ` character at the beginning of the line and extending to the end of the line\&. Newlines in the input are represented by a tilde
\fB~\fR
on a line of its own\&.
.RE
.PP
none
.RS 4
Disable word diff again\&.
.RE
.sp
Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to highlight the changed parts in all modes if enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-word\-diff\-regex=<regex>
.RS 4
Use <regex> to decide what a word is, instead of considering runs of non\-whitespace to be a word\&. Also implies
\fB\-\-word\-diff\fR
unless it was already enabled\&.
.sp
Every non\-overlapping match of the <regex> is considered a word\&. Anything between these matches is considered whitespace and ignored(!) for the purposes of finding differences\&. You may want to append
\fB|[^[:space:]]\fR
to your regular expression to make sure that it matches all non\-whitespace characters\&. A match that contains a newline is silently truncated(!) at the newline\&.
.sp
For example,
\fB\-\-word\-diff\-regex=\&.\fR
will treat each character as a word and, correspondingly, show differences character by character\&.
.sp
The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration option, see
\fBgitattributes\fR(5)
or
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&. Giving it explicitly overrides any diff driver or configuration setting\&. Diff drivers override configuration settings\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-color\-words[=<regex>]
.RS 4
Equivalent to
\fB\-\-word\-diff=color\fR
plus (if a regex was specified)
\fB\-\-word\-diff\-regex=<regex>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-renames
.RS 4
Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the default to do so\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]rename\-empty
.RS 4
Whether to use empty blobs as rename source\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-check
.RS 4
Warn if changes introduce conflict markers or whitespace errors\&. What are considered whitespace errors is controlled by
\fBcore\&.whitespace\fR
configuration\&. By default, trailing whitespaces (including lines that consist solely of whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of the line are considered whitespace errors\&. Exits with non\-zero status if problems are found\&. Not compatible with \-\-exit\-code\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ws\-error\-highlight=<kind>
.RS 4
Highlight whitespace errors in the
\fBcontext\fR,
\fBold\fR
or
\fBnew\fR
lines of the diff\&. Multiple values are separated by comma,
\fBnone\fR
resets previous values,
\fBdefault\fR
reset the list to
\fBnew\fR
and
\fBall\fR
is a shorthand for
\fBold,new,context\fR\&. When this option is not given, and the configuration variable
\fBdiff\&.wsErrorHighlight\fR
is not set, only whitespace errors in
\fBnew\fR
lines are highlighted\&. The whitespace errors are colored with
\fBcolor\&.diff\&.whitespace\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-index
.RS 4
Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full pre\- and post\-image blob object names on the "index" line when generating patch format output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-binary
.RS 4
In addition to
\fB\-\-full\-index\fR, output a binary diff that can be applied with
\fBgit\-apply\fR\&. Implies
\fB\-\-patch\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev[=<n>]
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal object name in diff\-raw format output and diff\-tree header lines, show the shortest prefix that is at least
\fI<n>\fR
hexdigits long that uniquely refers the object\&. In diff\-patch output format,
\fB\-\-full\-index\fR
takes higher precedence, i\&.e\&. if
\fB\-\-full\-index\fR
is specified, full blob names will be shown regardless of
\fB\-\-abbrev\fR\&. Non default number of digits can be specified with
\fB\-\-abbrev=<n>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-B[<n>][/<m>], \-\-break\-rewrites[=[<n>][/<m>]]
.RS 4
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create\&. This serves two purposes:
.sp
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
\fBm\fR
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 60%)\&.
\fB\-B/70%\fR
specifies that less than 30% of the original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i\&.e\&. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines)\&.
.sp
When used with \-M, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually \-M only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
\fBn\fR
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 50%)\&.
\fB\-B20%\fR
specifies that a change with addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file\(cqs size are eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-M[<n>], \-\-find\-renames[=<n>]
.RS 4
Detect renames\&. If
\fBn\fR
is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i\&.e\&. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file\(cqs size)\&. For example,
\fB\-M90%\fR
means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn\(cqt changed\&. Without a
\fB%\fR
sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it\&. I\&.e\&.,
\fB\-M5\fR
becomes 0\&.5, and is thus the same as
\fB\-M50%\fR\&. Similarly,
\fB\-M05\fR
is the same as
\fB\-M5%\fR\&. To limit detection to exact renames, use
\fB\-M100%\fR\&. The default similarity index is 50%\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C[<n>], \-\-find\-copies[=<n>]
.RS 4
Detect copies as well as renames\&. See also
\fB\-\-find\-copies\-harder\fR\&. If
\fBn\fR
is specified, it has the same meaning as for
\fB\-M<n>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-find\-copies\-harder
.RS 4
For performance reasons, by default,
\fB\-C\fR
option finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset\&. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy\&. This is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it with caution\&. Giving more than one
\fB\-C\fR
option has the same effect\&.
.RE
.PP
\-D, \-\-irreversible\-delete
.RS 4
Omit the preimage for deletes, i\&.e\&. print only the header but not the diff between the preimage and
\fB/dev/null\fR\&. The resulting patch is not meant to be applied with
\fBpatch\fR
or
\fBgit apply\fR; this is solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the change\&. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the option\&.
.sp
When used together with
\fB\-B\fR, omit also the preimage in the deletion part of a delete/create pair\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l<num>
.RS 4
The
\fB\-M\fR
and
\fB\-C\fR
options involve some preliminary steps that can detect subsets of renames/copies cheaply, followed by an exhaustive fallback portion that compares all remaining unpaired destinations to all relevant sources\&. (For renames, only remaining unpaired sources are relevant; for copies, all original sources are relevant\&.) For N sources and destinations, this exhaustive check is O(N^2)\&. This option prevents the exhaustive portion of rename/copy detection from running if the number of source/destination files involved exceeds the specified number\&. Defaults to diff\&.renameLimit\&. Note that a value of 0 is treated as unlimited\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-diff\-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)\&...[*]]
.RS 4
Select only files that are Added (\fBA\fR), Copied (\fBC\fR), Deleted (\fBD\fR), Modified (\fBM\fR), Renamed (\fBR\fR), have their type (i\&.e\&. regular file, symlink, submodule, \&...) changed (\fBT\fR), are Unmerged (\fBU\fR), are Unknown (\fBX\fR), or have had their pairing Broken (\fBB\fR)\&. Any combination of the filter characters (including none) can be used\&. When
\fB*\fR
(All\-or\-none) is added to the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that matches other criteria, nothing is selected\&.
.sp
Also, these upper\-case letters can be downcased to exclude\&. E\&.g\&.
\fB\-\-diff\-filter=ad\fR
excludes added and deleted paths\&.
.sp
Note that not all diffs can feature all types\&. For instance, copied and renamed entries cannot appear if detection for those types is disabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S<string>
.RS 4
Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of the specified string (i\&.e\&. addition/deletion) in a file\&. Intended for the scripter\(cqs use\&.
.sp
It is useful when you\(cqre looking for an exact block of code (like a struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first came into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting block in the preimage back into
\fB\-S\fR, and keep going until you get the very first version of the block\&.
.sp
Binary files are searched as well\&.
.RE
.PP
\-G<regex>
.RS 4
Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed lines that match <regex>\&.
.sp
To illustrate the difference between
\fB\-S<regex> \-\-pickaxe\-regex\fR
and
\fB\-G<regex>\fR, consider a commit with the following diff in the same file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
+    return frotz(nitfol, two\->ptr, 1, 0);
\&.\&.\&.
\-    hit = frotz(nitfol, mf2\&.ptr, 1, 0);
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
While
\fBgit log \-G"frotz\e(nitfol"\fR
will show this commit,
\fBgit log \-S"frotz\e(nitfol" \-\-pickaxe\-regex\fR
will not (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change)\&.
.sp

files refer to files after the commit\&. It is incorrect to apply each change to each file sequentially\&. For example, this patch will swap a and b:

.SH "COMBINED DIFF FORMAT"
.sp
Any diff\-generating command can take the \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-cc\fR option to produce a \fIcombined diff\fR when showing a merge\&. This is the default format when showing merges with \fBgit-diff\fR(1) or \fBgit-show\fR(1)\&. Note also that you can give suitable \fB\-\-diff\-merges\fR option to any of these commands to force generation of diffs in a specific format\&.
.sp
A "combined diff" format looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

It is preceded by a "git diff" header, that looks like this (when the
\fB\-c\fR
option is used):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
diff \-\-combined file
.fi
.if n \{\

or like this (when the

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c

.el \{\

It is followed by one or more extended header lines (this example shows a merge with two parents):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
index <hash>,<hash>\&.\&.<hash>
mode <mode>,<mode>\&.\&.<mode>
new file mode <mode>
deleted file mode <mode>,<mode>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The
\fBmode <mode>,<mode>\&.\&.<mode>\fR
line appears only if at least one of the <mode> is different from the rest\&. Extended headers with information about detected content movement (renames and copying detection) are designed to work with the diff of two <tree\-ish> and are not used by combined diff format\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  3." 4.2

It is followed by a two\-line from\-file/to\-file header:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-\-\- a/file
+++ b/file
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Similar to the two\-line header for the traditional
\fIunified\fR
diff format,
\fB/dev/null\fR
is used to signal created or deleted files\&.
.sp
However, if the \-\-combined\-all\-paths option is provided, instead of a two\-line from\-file/to\-file, you get an N+1 line from\-file/to\-file header, where N is the number of parents in the merge commit:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-\-\- a/file
\-\-\- a/file
\-\-\- a/file
+++ b/file
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This extended format can be useful if rename or copy detection is active, to allow you to see the original name of the file in different parents\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 4.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  4." 4.2
.\}
Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to
\fBpatch \-p1\fR\&. Combined diff format was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant to be applied\&. The change is similar to the change in the extended
\fIindex\fR
header:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
@@@ <from\-file\-range> <from\-file\-range> <to\-file\-range> @@@
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
There are (number of parents + 1)
\fB@\fR
characters in the chunk header for combined diff format\&.
.RE
.sp
Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \fB\-\fR (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), \fB+\fR (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or \fB" "\fR (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\&. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\(cqs line is different from it\&.
.sp
A \fB\-\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\&. A \fB+\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\&.
.sp
In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \fB\-\fR removals from both file1 and file2, plus \fB++\fR to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or file2)\&. Also, eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with \fB+\fR)\&.
.sp
When shown by \fBgit diff\-tree \-c\fR, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i\&.e\&. file1\&.\&.fileN are the parents)\&. When shown by \fBgit diff\-files \-c\fR, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file (i\&.e\&. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their version")\&.
.SH "OTHER DIFF FORMATS"
.sp
The \fB\-\-summary\fR option describes newly added, deleted, renamed and copied files\&. The \fB\-\-stat\fR option adds diffstat(1) graph to the output\&. These options can be combined with other options, such as \fB\-p\fR, and are meant for human consumption\&.
.sp
When showing a change that involves a rename or a copy, \fB\-\-stat\fR output formats the pathnames compactly by combining common prefix and suffix of the pathnames\&. For example, a change that moves \fBarch/i386/Makefile\fR to \fBarch/x86/Makefile\fR while modifying 4 lines will be shown like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
arch/{i386 => x86}/Makefile    |   4 +\-\-
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The \fB\-\-numstat\fR option gives the diffstat(1) information but is designed for easier machine consumption\&. An entry in \fB\-\-numstat\fR output looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
1       2       README

The extra \fBNUL\fR before the preimage path in renamed case is to allow scripts that read the output to tell if the current record being read is a single\-path record or a rename/copy record without reading ahead\&. After reading added and deleted lines, reading up to \fBNUL\fR would yield the pathname, but if that is \fBNUL\fR, the record will show two paths\&.
