.SH "NAME"
gitk \- The Git repository browser
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgitk\fR [<options>] [<revision range>] [\-\-] [<path>\&...]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Displays changes in a repository or a selected set of commits\&. This includes visualizing the commit graph, showing information related to each commit, and the files in the trees of each revision\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
To control which revisions to show, gitk supports most options applicable to the \fIgit rev\-list\fR command\&. It also supports a few options applicable to the \fIgit diff\-*\fR commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown\&. Finally, it supports some gitk\-specific options\&.
.sp
gitk generally only understands options with arguments in the \fIsticked\fR form (see \fBgitcli\fR(7)) due to limitations in the command\-line parser\&.
.SS "rev\-list options and arguments"
.sp
This manual page describes only the most frequently used options\&. See \fBgit-rev-list\fR(1) for a complete list\&.
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
Show all refs (branches, tags, etc\&.)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-branches[=<pattern>], \-\-tags[=<pattern>], \-\-remotes[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the branches (tags, remote branches, resp\&.) are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit refs to ones matching given shell glob\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-since=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits more recent than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-until=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits older than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-date\-order
.RS 4
Sort commits by date when possible\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merge
.RS 4
After an attempt to merge stops with conflicts, show the commits on the history between two branches (i\&.e\&. the HEAD and the MERGE_HEAD) that modify the conflicted files and do not exist on all the heads being merged\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-left\-right
.RS 4
Mark which side of a symmetric diff a commit is reachable from\&. Commits from the left side are prefixed with a
<
symbol and those from the right with a
>
symbol\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history
.RS 4
When filtering history with
\fI<path>\&...\fR, does not prune some history\&. (See "History simplification" in
\fBgit-log\fR(1)
for a more detailed explanation\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-merges
.RS 4
Additional option to
\fI\-\-full\-history\fR
to remove some needless merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits contributing to this merge\&. (See "History simplification" in
\fBgit-log\fR(1)
for a more detailed explanation\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-\-ancestry\-path
.RS 4
When given a range of commits to display (e\&.g\&.
\fIcommit1\&.\&.commit2\fR
or
\fIcommit2 ^commit1\fR), only display commits that exist directly on the ancestry chain between the
\fIcommit1\fR
and
\fIcommit2\fR, i\&.e\&. commits that are both descendants of
\fIcommit1\fR, and ancestors of
\fIcommit2\fR\&. (See "History simplification" in
\fBgit-log\fR(1)
for a more detailed explanation\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-L<start>,<end>:<file>, \-L:<regex>:<file>
.RS 4
Trace the evolution of the line range given by "<start>,<end>" (or the funcname regex <regex>) within the <file>\&. You may not give any pathspec limiters\&. This is currently limited to a walk starting from a single revision, i\&.e\&., you may only give zero or one positive revision arguments\&. You can specify this option more than once\&.
.sp
\fBNote:\fR
gitk (unlike
\fBgit-log\fR(1)) currently only understands this option if you specify it "glued together" with its argument\&. Do
\fBnot\fR
put a space after
\-L\&.
.sp
<start> and <end> can take one of these forms:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
number
.sp
If <start> or <end> is a number, it specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1)\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
/regex/
.sp
This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex\&. If <start> is a regex, it will search from the end of the previous
\-L
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&. If <start> is \(lq^/regex/\(rq, it will search from the start of file\&. If <end> is a regex, it will search starting at the line given by <start>\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
+offset or \-offset
.sp
This is only valid for <end> and will specify a number of lines before or after the line given by <start>\&.
.RE
.sp
If \(lq:<regex>\(rq is given in place of <start> and <end>, it denotes the range from the first funcname line that matches <regex>, up to the next funcname line\&. \(lq:<regex>\(rq searches from the end of the previous
\-L
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&. \(lq^:<regex>\(rq searches from the start of file\&.
.RE
.PP
<revision range>
.RS 4
Limit the revisions to show\&. This can be either a single revision meaning show from the given revision and back, or it can be a range in the form "\fI<from>\fR\&.\&.\fI<to>\fR" to show all revisions between
\fI<from>\fR
and back to
\fI<to>\fR\&. Note, more advanced revision selection can be applied\&. For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.
.RE
.PP
<path>\&...
.RS 4
Limit commits to the ones touching files in the given paths\&. Note, to avoid ambiguity with respect to revision names use "\-\-" to separate the paths from any preceding options\&.
.RE
.SS "gitk\-specific options"
.PP
\-\-argscmd=<command>
.RS 4
Command to be run each time gitk has to determine the revision range to show\&. The command is expected to print on its standard output a list of additional revisions to be shown, one per line\&. Use this instead of explicitly specifying a
\fI<revision range>\fR
if the set of commits to show may vary between refreshes\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-select\-commit=<ref>
.RS 4
Select the specified commit after loading the graph\&. Default behavior is equivalent to specifying
\fI\-\-select\-commit=HEAD\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
gitk v2\&.6\&.12\&.\&. include/scsi drivers/scsi
.RS 4
Show the changes since version
\fIv2\&.6\&.12\fR
that changed any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories
.RE
.PP
gitk \-\-since="2 weeks ago" \-\- gitk
.RS 4
Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file
\fIgitk\fR\&. The "\-\-" is necessary to avoid confusion with the
\fBbranch\fR
named
\fIgitk\fR
.RE
.PP
gitk \-\-max\-count=100 \-\-all \-\- Makefile
.RS 4
Show at most 100 changes made to the file
\fIMakefile\fR\&. Instead of only looking for changes in the current branch look in all branches\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.sp
User configuration and preferences are stored at:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/gitk\fR
if it exists, otherwise
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fI$HOME/\&.gitk\fR
if it exists
.RE
.sp
If neither of the above exist then \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/gitk\fR is created and used by default\&. If \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is not set it defaults to \fI$HOME/\&.config\fR in all cases\&.
.SH "HISTORY"
.sp
Gitk was the first graphical repository browser\&. It\(cqs written in tcl/tk and started off in a separate repository but was later merged into the main Git repository\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fIqgit(1)\fR
.RS 4
A repository browser written in C++ using Qt\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIgitview(1)\fR
.RS 4
A repository browser written in Python using Gtk\&. It\(cqs based on
\fIbzrk(1)\fR
and distributed in the contrib area of the Git repository\&.
.RE
.PP
\fItig(1)\fR
.RS 4
A minimal repository browser and Git tool output highlighter written in C using Ncurses\&.
.RE
.SH "GIT"
