.SH "NAME"
git-rebase \- Forward\-port local commits to the updated upstream head
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit rebase\fR [\-i | \-\-interactive] [options] [\-\-onto <newbase>]
        <upstream> [<branch>]
\fIgit rebase\fR [\-i | \-\-interactive] [options] \-\-onto <newbase>
        \-\-root [<branch>]
.fi
.sp
.sp
\fIgit rebase\fR \-\-continue | \-\-skip | \-\-abort
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
If <branch> is specified, \fIgit\-rebase\fR will perform an automatic git checkout <branch> before doing anything else\&. Otherwise it remains on the current branch\&.
.sp
All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not in <upstream> are saved to a temporary area\&. This is the same set of commits that would be shown by git log <upstream>\&.\&.HEAD (or git log HEAD, if \-\-root is specified)\&.
.sp
The current branch is reset to <upstream>, or <newbase> if the \-\-onto option was supplied\&. This has the exact same effect as git reset \-\-hard <upstream> (or <newbase>)\&. ORIG_HEAD is set to point at the tip of the branch before the reset\&.
.sp
The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area are then reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order\&. Note that any commits in HEAD which introduce the same textual changes as a commit in HEAD\&.\&.<upstream> are omitted (i\&.e\&., a patch already accepted upstream with a different commit message or timestamp will be skipped)\&.
.sp
It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from being completely automatic\&. You will have to resolve any such merge failure and run git rebase \-\-continue\&. Another option is to bypass the commit that caused the merge failure with git rebase \-\-skip\&. To restore the original <branch> and remove the \&.git/rebase\-apply working files, use the command git rebase \-\-abort instead\&.
.sp
Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C topic
         /
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
From this point, the result of either of the following commands:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase master
git rebase master topic
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
would be:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                  A\(aq\-\-B\(aq\-\-C\(aq topic
                 /
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The latter form is just a short\-hand of git checkout topic followed by git rebase master\&.
.sp
If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made (e\&.g\&., because you mailed a patch which was applied upstream), then that commit will be skipped\&. For example, running git rebase master on the following history (in which A\(aq and A introduce the same set of changes, but have different committer information):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C topic
         /
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-A\(aq\-\-\-F master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
will result in:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                   B\(aq\-\-\-C\(aq topic
                  /
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-A\(aq\-\-\-F master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Here is how you would transplant a topic branch based on one branch to another, to pretend that you forked the topic branch from the latter branch, using rebase \-\-onto\&.
.sp
First let\(aqs assume your \fItopic\fR is based on branch \fInext\fR\&. For example, a feature developed in \fItopic\fR depends on some functionality which is found in \fInext\fR\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  master
         \e
          o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  next
                           \e
                            o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  topic
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
We want to make \fItopic\fR forked from branch \fImaster\fR; for example, because the functionality on which \fItopic\fR depends was merged into the more stable \fImaster\fR branch\&. We want our tree to look like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  master
        |            \e
        |             o\(aq\-\-o\(aq\-\-o\(aq  topic
         \e
          o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  next
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
We can get this using the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-onto master next topic
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Another example of \-\-onto option is to rebase part of a branch\&. If we have the following situation:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                            H\-\-\-I\-\-\-J topicB
                           /
                  E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G  topicA
                 /
    A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C\-\-\-D  master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
then the command
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-onto master topicA topicB
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
would result in:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                 H\(aq\-\-I\(aq\-\-J\(aq  topicB
                /
                | E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G  topicA
                |/
    A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C\-\-\-D  master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA\&.
.sp
A range of commits could also be removed with rebase\&. If we have the following situation:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G\-\-\-H\-\-\-I\-\-\-J  topicA
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
then the command
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-onto topicA~5 topicA~3 topicA
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
would result in the removal of commits F and G:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    E\-\-\-H\(aq\-\-\-I\(aq\-\-\-J\(aq  topicA
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This is useful if F and G were flawed in some way, or should not be part of topicA\&. Note that the argument to \-\-onto and the <upstream> parameter can be any valid commit\-ish\&.
.sp
In case of conflict, \fIgit\-rebase\fR will stop at the first problematic commit and leave conflict markers in the tree\&. You can use \fIgit\-diff\fR to locate the markers (<<<<<<) and make edits to resolve the conflict\&. For each file you edit, you need to tell git that the conflict has been resolved, typically this would be done with
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git add <filename>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-continue
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Alternatively, you can undo the \fIgit\-rebase\fR with
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-abort
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
rebase\&.stat
.RS 4
Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the last rebase\&. False by default\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
<newbase>
.RS 4
Starting point at which to create the new commits\&. If the \-\-onto option is not specified, the starting point is <upstream>\&. May be any valid commit, and not just an existing branch name\&.
.RE

.PP
\-\-abort
.RS 4
Restore the original branch and abort the rebase operation\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-skip
.RS 4
Restart the rebasing process by skipping the current patch\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m, \-\-merge
.RS 4
Use merging strategies to rebase\&. When the recursive (default) merge strategy is used, this allows rebase to be aware of renames on the upstream side\&.
.sp
Note that a rebase merge works by replaying each commit from the working branch on top of the <upstream> branch\&. Because of this, when a merge conflict happens, the side reported as
\fIours\fR
is the so\-far rebased series, starting with <upstream>, and
\fItheirs\fR
is the working branch\&. In other words, the sides are swapped\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s <strategy>, \-\-strategy=<strategy>
.RS 4
Use the given merge strategy\&. If there is no
\-s
option
\fIgit\-merge\-recursive\fR
is used instead\&. This implies \-\-merge\&.
.sp
Because
\fIgit\-rebase\fR
replays each commit from the working branch on top of the <upstream> branch using the given strategy, using the
\fIours\fR
strategy simply discards all patches from the <branch>, which makes little sense\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
Be quiet\&. Implies \-\-no\-stat\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
Be verbose\&. Implies \-\-stat\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stat
.RS 4
Show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the last rebase\&. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration option rebase\&.stat\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-no\-stat
.RS 4
Do not show a diffstat as part of the rebase process\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-verify
.RS 4
This option bypasses the pre\-rebase hook\&. See also
\fBgithooks\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C<n>
.RS 4
Ensure at least <n> lines of surrounding context match before and after each change\&. When fewer lines of surrounding context exist they all must match\&. By default no context is ever ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f, \-\-force\-rebase
.RS 4
Force the rebase even if the current branch is a descendant of the commit you are rebasing onto\&. Normally the command will exit with the message "Current branch is up to date" in such a situation\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-whitespace, \-\-whitespace=<option>
.RS 4
These flag are passed to the
\fIgit\-apply\fR
program (see
\fBgit-apply\fR(1)) that applies the patch\&. Incompatible with the \-\-interactive option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-committer\-date\-is\-author\-date, \-\-ignore\-date
.RS 4
These flags are passed to
\fIgit\-am\fR
to easily change the dates of the rebased commits (see
\fBgit-am\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-interactive
.RS 4
Make a list of the commits which are about to be rebased\&. Let the user edit that list before rebasing\&. This mode can also be used to split commits (see SPLITTING COMMITS below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-preserve\-merges
.RS 4
Instead of ignoring merges, try to recreate them\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-root
.RS 4
Rebase all commits reachable from <branch>, instead of limiting them with an <upstream>\&. This allows you to rebase the root commit(s) on a branch\&. Must be used with \-\-onto, and will skip changes already contained in <newbase> (instead of <upstream>)\&. When used together with \-\-preserve\-merges,
\fIall\fR
root commits will be rewritten to have <newbase> as parent instead\&.
.RE
.SH "MERGE STRATEGIES"
.PP
resolve
.RS 4
This can only resolve two heads (i\&.e\&. the current branch and another branch you pulled from) using a 3\-way merge algorithm\&. It tries to carefully detect criss\-cross merge ambiguities and is considered generally safe and fast\&.
.RE
.PP
recursive
.RS 4
This can only resolve two heads using a 3\-way merge algorithm\&. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for 3\-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3\-way merge\&. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mis\-merges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2\&.6 kernel development history\&. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames\&. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch\&.
.RE
.PP
octopus
.RS 4
This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do a complex merge that needs manual resolution\&. It is primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads together\&. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch\&.
.RE
.PP
ours
.RS 4
This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring all changes from all other branches\&. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches\&.
.RE
.PP
subtree
.RS 4
This is a modified recursive strategy\&. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level\&. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree\&.
.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.sp
You should understand the implications of using \fIgit\-rebase\fR on a repository that you share\&. See also RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE below\&.
.sp
When the git\-rebase command is run, it will first execute a "pre\-rebase" hook if one exists\&. You can use this hook to do sanity checks and reject the rebase if it isn\(aqt appropriate\&. Please see the template pre\-rebase hook script for an example\&.
.sp
Upon completion, <branch> will be the current branch\&.
.SH "INTERACTIVE MODE"
.sp
Rebasing interactively means that you have a chance to edit the commits which are rebased\&. You can reorder the commits, and you can remove them (weeding out bad or otherwise unwanted patches)\&.
.sp
The interactive mode is meant for this type of workflow:
.sp
.RS 4

.el \{\

.RE
.RE
.sp
Sometimes the thing fixed in b\&.2\&. cannot be amended to the not\-quite perfect commit it fixes, because that commit is buried deeply in a patch series\&. That is exactly what interactive rebase is for: use it after plenty of "a"s and "b"s, by rearranging and editing commits, and squashing multiple commits into one\&.
.sp
Start it with the last commit you want to retain as\-is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-i <after\-this\-commit>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
An editor will be fired up with all the commits in your current branch (ignoring merge commits), which come after the given commit\&. You can reorder the commits in this list to your heart\(aqs content, and you can remove them\&. The list looks more or less like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pick deadbee The oneline of this commit
pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The oneline descriptions are purely for your pleasure; \fIgit\-rebase\fR will not look at them but at the commit names ("deadbee" and "fa1afe1" in this example), so do not delete or edit the names\&.
.sp
By replacing the command "pick" with the command "edit", you can tell \fIgit\-rebase\fR to stop after applying that commit, so that you can edit the files and/or the commit message, amend the commit, and continue rebasing\&.
.sp
If you just want to edit the commit message for a commit, replace the command "pick" with the command "reword"\&.
.sp
If you want to fold two or more commits into one, replace the command "pick" with "squash" for the second and subsequent commit\&. If the commits had different authors, it will attribute the squashed commit to the author of the first commit\&.
.sp
\fIgit\-rebase\fR will stop when "pick" has been replaced with "edit" or when a command fails due to merge errors\&. When you are done editing and/or resolving conflicts you can continue with git rebase \-\-continue\&.
.sp
For example, if you want to reorder the last 5 commits, such that what was HEAD~4 becomes the new HEAD\&. To achieve that, you would call \fIgit\-rebase\fR like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git rebase \-i HEAD~5
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
And move the first patch to the end of the list\&.
.sp
You might want to preserve merges, if you have a history like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
           X
            \e
         A\-\-\-M\-\-\-B
        /
\-\-\-o\-\-\-O\-\-\-P\-\-\-Q
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Suppose you want to rebase the side branch starting at "A" to "Q"\&. Make sure that the current HEAD is "B", and call
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git rebase \-i \-p \-\-onto Q O
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "SPLITTING COMMITS"
.sp
In interactive mode, you can mark commits with the action "edit"\&. However, this does not necessarily mean that \fIgit\-rebase\fR expects the result of this edit to be exactly one commit\&. Indeed, you can undo the commit, or you can add other commits\&. This can be used to split a commit into two:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Start an interactive rebase with
git rebase \-i <commit>^, where <commit> is the commit you want to split\&. In fact, any commit range will do, as long as it contains that commit\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Mark the commit you want to split with the action "edit"\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
When it comes to editing that commit, execute
git reset HEAD^\&. The effect is that the HEAD is rewound by one, and the index follows suit\&. However, the working tree stays the same\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Now add the changes to the index that you want to have in the first commit\&. You can use
git add
(possibly interactively) or
\fIgit\-gui\fR
(or both) to do that\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Commit the now\-current index with whatever commit message is appropriate now\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Repeat the last two steps until your working tree is clean\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\

Continue the rebase with
git rebase \-\-continue\&.
.RE
.sp
If you are not absolutely sure that the intermediate revisions are consistent (they compile, pass the testsuite, etc\&.) you should use \fIgit\-stash\fR to stash away the not\-yet\-committed changes after each commit, test, and amend the commit if fixes are necessary\&.
.SH "RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE"
.sp
Rebasing (or any other form of rewriting) a branch that others have based work on is a bad idea: anyone downstream of it is forced to manually fix their history\&. This section explains how to do the fix from the downstream\(aqs point of view\&. The real fix, however, would be to avoid rebasing the upstream in the first place\&.
.sp
To illustrate, suppose you are in a situation where someone develops a \fIsubsystem\fR branch, and you are working on a \fItopic\fR that is dependent on this \fIsubsystem\fR\&. You might end up with a history like the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  master
         \e

If you now continue development as usual, and eventually merge \fItopic\fR to \fIsubsystem\fR, the commits from \fIsubsystem\fR will remain duplicated forever:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  master

Such duplicates are generally frowned upon because they clutter up history, making it harder to follow\&. To clean things up, you need to transplant the commits on \fItopic\fR to the new \fIsubsystem\fR tip, i\&.e\&., rebase \fItopic\fR\&. This becomes a ripple effect: anyone downstream from \fItopic\fR is forced to rebase too, and so on!
.sp
There are two kinds of fixes, discussed in the following subsections:
.PP
Easy case: The changes are literally the same\&.
.RS 4
This happens if the
\fIsubsystem\fR
rebase was a simple rebase and had no conflicts\&.
.RE
.PP
Hard case: The changes are not the same\&.
.RS 4
This happens if the
\fIsubsystem\fR
rebase had conflicts, or used
\-\-interactive
to omit, edit, or squash commits; or if the upstream used one of
commit \-\-amend,
reset, or
filter\-branch\&.
.RE
.SS "The easy case"
.sp
Only works if the changes (patch IDs based on the diff contents) on \fIsubsystem\fR are literally the same before and after the rebase \fIsubsystem\fR did\&.
.sp
In that case, the fix is easy because \fIgit\-rebase\fR knows to skip changes that are already present in the new upstream\&. So if you say (assuming you\(aqre on \fItopic\fR)
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    $ git rebase subsystem
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
you will end up with the fixed history

Things get more complicated if the \fIsubsystem\fR changes do not exactly correspond to the ones before the rebase\&.

While an "easy case recovery" sometimes appears to be successful even in the hard case, it may have unintended consequences\&. For example, a commit that was removed via git rebase \-\-interactive will be \fB*resurrected\fR*!
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
The idea is to manually tell \fIgit\-rebase\fR "where the old \fIsubsystem\fR ended and your \fItopic\fR began", that is, what the old merge\-base between them was\&. You will have to find a way to name the last commit of the old \fIsubsystem\fR, for example:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
With the
\fIsubsystem\fR
reflog: after
\fIgit\-fetch\fR, the old tip of
\fIsubsystem\fR
is at
subsystem@{1}\&. Subsequent fetches will increase the number\&. (See
\fBgit-reflog\fR(1)\&.)
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Relative to the tip of
\fItopic\fR: knowing that your
\fItopic\fR
has three commits, the old tip of
\fIsubsystem\fR
must be
topic~3\&.
.RE
.sp
You can then transplant the old subsystem\&.\&.topic to the new tip by saying (for the reflog case, and assuming you are on \fItopic\fR already):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    $ git rebase \-\-onto subsystem subsystem@{1}
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The ripple effect of a "hard case" recovery is especially bad: \fIeveryone\fR downstream from \fItopic\fR will now have to perform a "hard case" recovery too!
