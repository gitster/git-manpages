.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command manages the information recorded in the reflogs\&.
.sp
Reference logs, or "reflogs", record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository\&. Reflogs are useful in various Git commands, to specify the old value of a reference\&. For example, \fBHEAD@\fR{2} means "where HEAD used to be two moves ago", \fBmaster@\fR{one\&.\fBweek\&.ago\fR} means "where master used to point to one week ago in this local repository", and so on\&. See \fBgitrevisions\fR(7) for more details\&.
.sp
The command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand:
.sp
The "show" subcommand (which is also the default, in the absence of any subcommands) shows the log of the reference provided in the command\-line (or \fBHEAD\fR, by default)\&. The reflog covers all recent actions, and in addition the \fBHEAD\fR reflog records branch switching\&. \fBgit\fR \fBreflog\fR \fBshow\fR is an alias for \fBgit\fR \fBlog\fR \fB\-g\fR \fB\-\-abbrev\-commit\fR \fB\-\-pretty=oneline\fR; see \fBgit-log\fR(1) for more information\&.
.sp
The "list" subcommand lists all refs which have a corresponding reflog\&.
.sp
The "expire" subcommand prunes older reflog entries\&. Entries older than \fBexpire\fR time, or entries older than \fBexpire\-unreachable\fR time and not reachable from the current tip, are removed from the reflog\&. This is typically not used directly by end users \(em instead, see \fBgit-gc\fR(1)\&.
.sp
The "delete" subcommand deletes single entries from the reflog, but not the reflog itself\&. Its argument must be an \fIexact\fR entry (e\&.g\&. "\fBgit\fR \fBreflog\fR \fBdelete\fR \fBmaster@\fR{2}")\&. This subcommand is also typically not used directly by end users\&.
.sp
The "drop" subcommand completely removes the reflog for the specified references\&. This is in contrast to "expire" and "delete", both of which can be used to delete reflog entries, but not the reflog itself\&.
.sp
The "exists" subcommand checks whether a ref has a reflog\&. It exits with zero status if the reflog exists, and non\-zero status if it does not\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Options for \fBshow\fR"
.sp
\fBgit\fR \fBreflog\fR \fBshow\fR accepts any of the options accepted by \fBgit\fR \fBlog\fR\&.
.SS "Options for \fBexpire\fR"
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
Process the reflogs of all references\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-single\-worktree
.RS 4
By default when
\fB\-\-all\fR
is specified, reflogs from all working trees are processed\&. This option limits the processing to reflogs from the current working tree only\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-expire=<time>
.RS 4
Prune entries older than the specified time\&. If this option is not specified, the expiration time is taken from the configuration setting
\fBgc\&.reflogExpire\fR, which in turn defaults to 90 days\&.
\fB\-\-expire=all\fR
prunes entries regardless of their age;
\fB\-\-expire=never\fR
turns off pruning of reachable entries (but see
\fB\-\-expire\-unreachable\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-expire\-unreachable=<time>
.RS 4
Prune entries older than
\fI<time>\fR
that are not reachable from the current tip of the branch\&. If this option is not specified, the expiration time is taken from the configuration setting
\fBgc\&.reflogExpireUnreachable\fR, which in turn defaults to 30 days\&.
\fB\-\-expire\-unreachable=all\fR
prunes unreachable entries regardless of their age;
\fB\-\-expire\-unreachable=never\fR
turns off early pruning of unreachable entries (but see
\fB\-\-expire\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-updateref
.RS 4
Update the reference to the value of the top reflog entry (i\&.e\&. <ref>@{0}) if the previous top entry was pruned\&. (This option is ignored for symbolic references\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-\-rewrite
.RS 4
If a reflog entry\(cqs predecessor is pruned, adjust its "old" SHA\-1 to be equal to the "new" SHA\-1 field of the entry that now precedes it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stale\-fix
.RS 4
Prune any reflog entries that point to "broken commits"\&. A broken commit is a commit that is not reachable from any of the reference tips and that refers, directly or indirectly, to a missing commit, tree, or blob object\&.
.sp
This computation involves traversing all the reachable objects, i\&.e\&. it has the same cost as
\fIgit prune\fR\&. It is primarily intended to fix corruption caused by garbage collecting using older versions of Git, which didn\(cqt protect objects referred to by reflogs\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-dry\-run
.RS 4
Do not actually prune any entries; just show what would have been pruned\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-verbose
.RS 4
Print extra information on screen\&.
.RE
.SS "Options for \fBdelete\fR"
.sp
\fBgit\fR \fBreflog\fR \fBdelete\fR accepts options \fB\-\-updateref\fR, \fB\-\-rewrite\fR, \fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR, and \fB\-\-verbose\fR, with the same meanings as when they are used with \fBexpire\fR\&.
.SS "Options for \fBdrop\fR"
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
Drop the reflogs of all references from all worktrees\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-single\-worktree
.RS 4
By default when
\fB\-\-all\fR
is specified, reflogs from all working trees are dropped\&. This option limits the processing to reflogs from the current working tree only\&.
.RE
