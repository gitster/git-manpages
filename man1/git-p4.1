.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command provides a way to interact with p4 repositories using git\&.
.sp
Create a new git repository from an existing p4 repository using \fIgit p4 clone\fR, giving it one or more p4 depot paths\&. Incorporate new commits from p4 changes with \fIgit p4 sync\fR\&. The \fIsync\fR command is also used to include new branches from other p4 depot paths\&. Submit git changes back to p4 using \fIgit p4 submit\fR\&. The command \fIgit p4 rebase\fR does a sync plus rebases the current branch onto the updated p4 remote branch\&.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.SS "Clone"
.sp
Generally, \fIgit p4 clone\fR is used to create a new git directory from an existing p4 repository:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git p4 clone //depot/path/project
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
Creates an empty git repository in a subdirectory called
\fIproject\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
Imports the full contents of the head revision from the given p4 depot path into a single commit in the git branch
\fIrefs/remotes/p4/master\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  3." 4.2
.\}
Creates a local branch,
\fImaster\fR
from this remote and checks it out\&.
.RE
.sp
To reproduce the entire p4 history in git, use the \fI@all\fR modifier on the depot path:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git p4 clone //depot/path/project@all
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SS "Sync"
.sp
As development continues in the p4 repository, those changes can be included in the git repository using:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git p4 sync
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This command finds new changes in p4 and imports them as git commits\&.
.sp
P4 repositories can be added to an existing git repository using \fIgit p4 sync\fR too:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ mkdir repo\-git
$ cd repo\-git
$ git init
$ git p4 sync //path/in/your/perforce/depot
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This imports the specified depot into \fIrefs/remotes/p4/master\fR in an existing git repository\&. The \fI\-\-branch\fR option can be used to specify a different branch to be used for the p4 content\&.
.sp
If a git repository includes branches \fIrefs/remotes/origin/p4\fR, these will be fetched and consulted first during a \fIgit p4 sync\fR\&. Since importing directly from p4 is considerably slower than pulling changes from a git remote, this can be useful in a multi\-developer environment\&.
.SS "Rebase"
.sp
A common working pattern is to fetch the latest changes from the p4 depot and merge them with local uncommitted changes\&. Often, the p4 repository is the ultimate location for all code, thus a rebase workflow makes sense\&. This command does \fIgit p4 sync\fR followed by \fIgit rebase\fR to move local commits on top of updated p4 changes\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git p4 rebase
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SS "Submit"
.sp
Submitting changes from a git repository back to the p4 repository requires a separate p4 client workspace\&. This should be specified using the \fIP4CLIENT\fR environment variable or the git configuration variable \fIgit\-p4\&.client\fR\&. The p4 client must exist, but the client root will be created and populated if it does not already exist\&.
.sp
To submit all changes that are in the current git branch but not in the \fIp4/master\fR branch, use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git p4 submit
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
To specify a branch other than the current one, use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git p4 submit topicbranch
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The upstream reference is generally \fIrefs/remotes/p4/master\fR, but can be overridden using the \fI\-\-origin=\fR command\-line option\&.
.sp
The p4 changes will be created as the user invoking \fIgit p4 submit\fR\&. The \fI\-\-preserve\-user\fR option will cause ownership to be modified according to the author of the git commit\&. This option requires admin privileges in p4, which can be granted using \fIp4 protect\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "General options"
.sp
All commands except clone accept this option\&.
.PP
\-\-git\-dir <dir>
.RS 4
Set the
\fIGIT_DIR\fR
environment variable\&. See
\fBgit\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.SS "Sync options"
.sp
These options can be used in the initial \fIclone\fR as well as in subsequent \fIsync\fR operations\&.
.PP
\-\-branch <branch>
.RS 4
Import changes into given branch\&. If the branch starts with
\fIrefs/\fR, it will be used as is, otherwise the path
\fIrefs/heads/\fR
will be prepended\&. The default branch is
\fImaster\fR\&. If used with an initial clone, no HEAD will be checked out\&.
.sp
This example imports a new remote "p4/proj2" into an existing git repository:
.RE
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    $ git init
    $ git p4 sync \-\-branch=refs/remotes/p4/proj2 //depot/proj2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.PP
\-\-detect\-branches
.RS 4
Use the branch detection algorithm to find new paths in p4\&. It is documented below in "BRANCH DETECTION"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-changesfile <file>
.RS 4
Import exactly the p4 change numbers listed in
\fIfile\fR, one per line\&. Normally,
\fIgit p4\fR
inspects the current p4 repository state and detects the changes it should import\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-silent
.RS 4
Do not print any progress information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-verbose
.RS 4
Provide more progress information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-detect\-labels
.RS 4
Query p4 for labels associated with the depot paths, and add them as tags in git\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-import\-local
.RS 4
By default, p4 branches are stored in
\fIrefs/remotes/p4/\fR, where they will be treated as remote\-tracking branches by
\fBgit-branch\fR(1)
and other commands\&. This option instead puts p4 branches in
\fIrefs/heads/p4/\fR\&. Note that future sync operations must specify
\fI\-\-import\-local\fR
as well so that they can find the p4 branches in refs/heads\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-max\-changes <n>
.RS 4
Limit the number of imported changes to
\fIn\fR\&. Useful to limit the amount of history when using the
\fI@all\fR
p4 revision specifier\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-keep\-path
.RS 4
The mapping of file names from the p4 depot path to git, by default, involves removing the entire depot path\&. With this option, the full p4 depot path is retained in git\&. For example, path
\fI//depot/main/foo/bar\&.c\fR, when imported from
\fI//depot/main/\fR, becomes
\fIfoo/bar\&.c\fR\&. With
\fI\-\-keep\-path\fR, the git path is instead
\fIdepot/main/foo/bar\&.c\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-use\-client\-spec
.RS 4
Use a client spec to find the list of interesting files in p4\&. See the "CLIENT SPEC" section below\&.
.RE
.SS "Clone options"
.sp
These options can be used in an initial \fIclone\fR, along with the \fIsync\fR options described above\&.
.PP
\-\-destination <directory>
.RS 4
Where to create the git repository\&. If not provided, the last component in the p4 depot path is used to create a new directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bare
.RS 4
Perform a bare clone\&. See
\fBgit-clone\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-/ <path>
.RS 4
Exclude selected depot paths when cloning\&.
.RE
.SS "Submit options"
.sp
These options can be used to modify \fIgit p4 submit\fR behavior\&.
.PP
\-\-verbose
.RS 4
Provide more progress information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-origin <commit>
.RS 4
Upstream location from which commits are identified to submit to p4\&. By default, this is the most recent p4 commit reachable from
\fIHEAD\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-M[<n>]
.RS 4
Detect renames\&. See
\fBgit-diff\fR(1)\&. Renames will be represented in p4 using explicit
\fImove\fR
operations\&. There is no corresponding option to detect copies, but there are variables for both moves and copies\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-preserve\-user
.RS 4
Re\-author p4 changes before submitting to p4\&. This option requires p4 admin privileges\&.
.RE
.SH "DEPOT PATH SYNTAX"
.sp
The p4 depot path argument to \fIgit p4 sync\fR and \fIgit p4 clone\fR can be one or more space\-separated p4 depot paths, with an optional p4 revision specifier on the end:
.PP
"//depot/my/project"
.RS 4
Import one commit with all files in the
\fI#head\fR
change under that tree\&.
.RE
.PP
"//depot/my/project@all"
.RS 4
Import one commit for each change in the history of that depot path\&.
.RE
.PP
"//depot/my/project@1,6"
.RS 4
Import only changes 1 through 6\&.
.RE
.PP
"//depot/proj1@all //depot/proj2@all"
.RS 4
Import all changes from both named depot paths into a single repository\&. Only files below these directories are included\&. There is not a subdirectory in git for each "proj1" and "proj2"\&. You must use the
\fI\-\-destination\fR
option when specifying more than one depot path\&. The revision specifier must be specified identically on each depot path\&. If there are files in the depot paths with the same name, the path with the most recently updated version of the file is the one that appears in git\&.
.RE
.sp
See \fIp4 help revisions\fR for the full syntax of p4 revision specifiers\&.
.SH "CLIENT SPEC"
.sp
The p4 client specification is maintained with the \fIp4 client\fR command and contains among other fields, a View that specifies how the depot is mapped into the client repository\&. Git\-p4 can consult the client spec when given the \fI\-\-use\-client\-spec\fR option or useClientSpec variable\&.
.sp
The full syntax for a p4 view is documented in \fIp4 help views\fR\&. Git\-p4 knows only a subset of the view syntax\&. It understands multi\-line mappings, overlays with \fI+\fR, exclusions with \fI\-\fR and double\-quotes around whitespace\&. Of the possible wildcards, git\-p4 only handles \fI\&...\fR, and only when it is at the end of the path\&. Git\-p4 will complain if it encounters an unhandled wildcard\&.
.sp
Bugs in the implementation of overlap mappings exist\&. If multiple depot paths map through overlays to the same location in the repository, git\-p4 can choose the wrong one\&. This is hard to solve without dedicating a client spec just for git\-p4\&.
.sp
The name of the client can be given to git\-p4 in multiple ways\&. The variable \fIgit\-p4\&.client\fR takes precedence if it exists\&. Otherwise, normal p4 mechanisms of determining the client are used: environment variable P4CLIENT, a file referenced by P4CONFIG, or the local host name\&.
.SH "BRANCH DETECTION"
.sp
P4 does not have the same concept of a branch as git\&. Instead, p4 organizes its content as a directory tree, where by convention different logical branches are in different locations in the tree\&. The \fIp4 branch\fR command is used to maintain mappings between different areas in the tree, and indicate related content\&. \fIgit p4\fR can use these mappings to determine branch relationships\&.
.sp
If you have a repository where all the branches of interest exist as subdirectories of a single depot path, you can use \fI\-\-detect\-branches\fR when cloning or syncing to have \fIgit p4\fR automatically find subdirectories in p4, and to generate these as branches in git\&.
.sp
For example, if the P4 repository structure is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
//depot/main/\&.\&.\&.
//depot/branch1/\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
And "p4 branch \-o branch1" shows a View line that looks like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
//depot/main/\&.\&.\&. //depot/branch1/\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Then this \fIgit p4 clone\fR command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git p4 clone \-\-detect\-branches //depot@all
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
produces a separate branch in \fIrefs/remotes/p4/\fR for //depot/main, called \fImaster\fR, and one for //depot/branch1 called \fIdepot/branch1\fR\&.
.sp
However, it is not necessary to create branches in p4 to be able to use them like branches\&. Because it is difficult to infer branch relationships automatically, a git configuration setting \fIgit\-p4\&.branchList\fR can be used to explicitly identify branch relationships\&. It is a list of "source:destination" pairs, like a simple p4 branch specification, where the "source" and "destination" are the path elements in the p4 repository\&. The example above relied on the presence of the p4 branch\&. Without p4 branches, the same result will occur with:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git config git\-p4\&.branchList main:branch1
git p4 clone \-\-detect\-branches //depot@all
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.sp
The fast\-import mechanism used by \fIgit p4\fR creates one pack file for each invocation of \fIgit p4 sync\fR\&. Normally, git garbage compression (\fBgit-gc\fR(1)) automatically compresses these to fewer pack files, but explicit invocation of \fIgit repack \-adf\fR may improve performance\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
The following config settings can be used to modify \fIgit p4\fR behavior\&. They all are in the \fIgit\-p4\fR section\&.
