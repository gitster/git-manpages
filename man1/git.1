.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high\-level operations and full access to internals\&.
.sp
See \fBgittutorial\fR(7) to get started, then see \fBgiteveryday\fR(7) for a useful minimum set of commands\&. The \m[blue]\fBGit User\(cqs Manual\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2 has a more in\-depth introduction\&.
.sp
After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers\&. You can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command"\&. \fBgitcli\fR(7) manual page gives you an overview of the command\-line command syntax\&.
.sp
A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at \m[blue]\fBhttps://git\&.github\&.io/htmldocs/git\&.html\fR\m[] or \m[blue]\fBhttps://git\-scm\&.com/docs\fR\m[]\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-v, \-\-version
.RS 4
Prints the Git suite version that the
\fIgit\fR
program came from\&.
.sp
This option is internally converted to
\fBgit version \&.\&.\&.\fR
and accepts the same options as the
\fBgit-version\fR(1)
command\&. If
\fB\-\-help\fR
is also given, it takes precedence over
\fB\-\-version\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h, \-\-help
.RS 4
Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands\&. If the option
\fB\-\-all\fR
or
\fB\-a\fR
is given then all available commands are printed\&. If a Git command is named this option will bring up the manual page for that command\&.
.sp
Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed\&. See
\fBgit-help\fR(1)
for more information, because
\fBgit \-\-help \&.\&.\&.\fR
is converted internally into
\fBgit help \&.\&.\&.\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C <path>
.RS 4
Run as if git was started in
\fI<path>\fR
instead of the current working directory\&. When multiple
\fB\-C\fR
options are given, each subsequent non\-absolute
\fB\-C <path>\fR
is interpreted relative to the preceding
\fB\-C <path>\fR\&. If
\fI<path>\fR
is present but empty, e\&.g\&.
\fB\-C ""\fR, then the current working directory is left unchanged\&.
.sp
This option affects options that expect path name like
\fB\-\-git\-dir\fR
and
\fB\-\-work\-tree\fR
in that their interpretations of the path names would be made relative to the working directory caused by the
\fB\-C\fR
option\&. For example the following invocations are equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git \-\-git\-dir=a\&.git \-\-work\-tree=b \-C c status
git \-\-git\-dir=c/a\&.git \-\-work\-tree=c/b status
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\-c <name>=<value>
.RS 4
Pass a configuration parameter to the command\&. The value given will override values from configuration files\&. The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by
\fIgit config\fR
(subkeys separated by dots)\&.
.sp
Note that omitting the
\fB=\fR
in
\fBgit \-c foo\&.bar \&.\&.\&.\fR
is allowed and sets
\fBfoo\&.bar\fR
to the boolean true value (just like
\fB[foo]bar\fR
would in a config file)\&. Including the equals but with an empty value (like
\fBgit \-c foo\&.bar= \&.\&.\&.\fR) sets
\fBfoo\&.bar\fR
to the empty string which
\fBgit config \-\-type=bool\fR
will convert to
\fBfalse\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-config\-env=<name>=<envvar>
.RS 4
Like
\fB\-c <name>=<value>\fR, give configuration variable
\fI<name>\fR
a value, where <envvar> is the name of an environment variable from which to retrieve the value\&. Unlike
\fB\-c\fR
there is no shortcut for directly setting the value to an empty string, instead the environment variable itself must be set to the empty string\&. It is an error if the
\fB<envvar>\fR
does not exist in the environment\&.
\fB<envvar>\fR
may not contain an equals sign to avoid ambiguity with
\fB<name>\fR
containing one\&.
.sp
This is useful for cases where you want to pass transitory configuration options to git, but are doing so on operating systems where other processes might be able to read your command line (e\&.g\&.
\fB/proc/self/cmdline\fR), but not your environment (e\&.g\&.
\fB/proc/self/environ\fR)\&. That behavior is the default on Linux, but may not be on your system\&.
.sp
Note that this might add security for variables such as
\fBhttp\&.extraHeader\fR
where the sensitive information is part of the value, but not e\&.g\&.
\fBurl\&.<base>\&.insteadOf\fR
where the sensitive information can be part of the key\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exec\-path[=<path>]
.RS 4
Path to wherever your core Git programs are installed\&. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_EXEC_PATH environment variable\&. If no path is given,
\fIgit\fR
will print the current setting and then exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-html\-path
.RS 4
Print the path, without trailing slash, where Git\(cqs HTML documentation is installed and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-man\-path
.RS 4
Print the manpath (see
\fBman(1)\fR) for the man pages for this version of Git and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-info\-path
.RS 4
Print the path where the Info files documenting this version of Git are installed and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-paginate
.RS 4
Pipe all output into
\fIless\fR
(or if set, $PAGER) if standard output is a terminal\&. This overrides the
\fBpager\&.<cmd>\fR
configuration options (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-P, \-\-no\-pager
.RS 4
Do not pipe Git output into a pager\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-git\-dir=<path>
.RS 4
Set the path to the repository ("\&.git" directory)\&. This can also be controlled by setting the
\fBGIT_DIR\fR
environment variable\&. It can be an absolute path or relative path to current working directory\&.
.sp
Specifying the location of the "\&.git" directory using this option (or
\fBGIT_DIR\fR
environment variable) turns off the repository discovery that tries to find a directory with "\&.git" subdirectory (which is how the repository and the top\-level of the working tree are discovered), and tells Git that you are at the top level of the working tree\&. If you are not at the top\-level directory of the working tree, you should tell Git where the top\-level of the working tree is, with the
\fB\-\-work\-tree=<path>\fR
option (or
\fBGIT_WORK_TREE\fR
environment variable)
.sp
If you just want to run git as if it was started in
\fB<path>\fR
then use
\fBgit \-C <path>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-work\-tree=<path>
.RS 4
Set the path to the working tree\&. It can be an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory\&. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable and the core\&.worktree configuration variable (see core\&.worktree in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
for a more detailed discussion)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-namespace=<path>
.RS 4
Set the Git namespace\&. See
\fBgitnamespaces\fR(7)
for more details\&. Equivalent to setting the
\fBGIT_NAMESPACE\fR
environment variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bare
.RS 4
Treat the repository as a bare repository\&. If GIT_DIR environment is not set, it is set to the current working directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-replace\-objects
.RS 4
Do not use replacement refs to replace Git objects\&. This is equivalent to exporting the
\fBGIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS\fR
environment variable with any value\&. See
\fBgit-replace\fR(1)
for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-lazy\-fetch
.RS 4
Do not fetch missing objects from the promisor remote on demand\&. Useful together with
\fBgit cat\-file \-e <object>\fR
to see if the object is locally available\&. This is equivalent to setting the
\fBGIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH\fR
environment variable to
\fB1\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-optional\-locks
.RS 4
Do not perform optional operations that require locks\&. This is equivalent to setting the
\fBGIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS\fR
to
\fB0\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-advice
.RS 4
Disable all advice hints from being printed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-literal\-pathspecs
.RS 4
Treat pathspecs literally (i\&.e\&. no globbing, no pathspec magic)\&. This is equivalent to setting the
\fBGIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS\fR
environment variable to
\fB1\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-glob\-pathspecs
.RS 4
Add "glob" magic to all pathspec\&. This is equivalent to setting the
\fBGIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS\fR
environment variable to
\fB1\fR\&. Disabling globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic ":(literal)"
.RE
.PP
\-\-noglob\-pathspecs
.RS 4
Add "literal" magic to all pathspec\&. This is equivalent to setting the
\fBGIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS\fR
environment variable to
\fB1\fR\&. Enabling globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic ":(glob)"
.RE
.PP
\-\-icase\-pathspecs
.RS 4
Add "icase" magic to all pathspec\&. This is equivalent to setting the
\fBGIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS\fR
environment variable to
\fB1\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-list\-cmds=<group>[,<group>\&...]
.RS 4
List commands by group\&. This is an internal/experimental option and may change or be removed in the future\&. Supported groups are: builtins, parseopt (builtin commands that use parse\-options), main (all commands in libexec directory), others (all other commands in
\fB$PATH\fR
that have git\- prefix), list\-<category> (see categories in command\-list\&.txt), nohelpers (exclude helper commands), alias and config (retrieve command list from config variable completion\&.commands)
.RE
.PP
\-\-attr\-source=<tree\-ish>
.RS 4
Read gitattributes from <tree\-ish> instead of the worktree\&. See
\fBgitattributes\fR(5)\&. This is equivalent to setting the
\fBGIT_ATTR_SOURCE\fR
environment variable\&.
.RE
.SH "GIT COMMANDS"
.sp

.SH "LOW\-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)"

Although Git includes its own porcelain layer, its low\-level commands are sufficient to support development of alternative porcelains\&. Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about \fBgit-update-index\fR(1) and \fBgit-read-tree\fR(1)\&.

The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to these low\-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily for scripted use\&.

Here are the variables:
.SS "The Git Repository"
.sp
These environment variables apply to \fIall\fR core Git commands\&. Nb: it is worth noting that they may be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above Git so take care if using a foreign front\-end\&.
.PP
\fBGIT_INDEX_FILE\fR

\fB$GIT_DIR/index\fR
is used\&.

\fBGIT_INDEX_VERSION\fR

Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be archived into shared, read\-only directories\&.

New objects will not be written to these directories\&.
.sp
Entries that begin with
\fB"\fR

\fBGIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES\fR

This should be a colon\-separated list of absolute paths\&. If set, it is a list of directories that Git should not chdir up into while looking for a repository directory (useful for excluding slow\-loading network directories)\&. It will not exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command line or in the environment\&. Normally, Git has to read the entries in this list and resolve any symlink that might be present in order to compare them with the current directory\&. However, if even this access is slow, you can add an empty entry to the list to tell Git that the subsequent entries are not symlinks and needn\(cqt be resolved; e\&.g\&.,
\fBGIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=/maybe/symlink::/very/slow/non/symlink\fR\&.
.RE

\fBGIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM\fR

When run in a directory that does not have "\&.git" repository directory, Git tries to find such a directory in the parent directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it does not cross filesystem boundaries\&. This Boolean environment variable can be set to true to tell Git not to stop at filesystem boundaries\&. Like
\fBGIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES\fR, this will not affect an explicit repository directory set via
\fBGIT_DIR\fR

.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
More detail on the following is available from the \m[blue]\fBGit concepts chapter of the user\-manual\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2 and \fBgitcore-tutorial\fR(7)\&.
.sp
A Git project normally consists of a working directory with a "\&.git" subdirectory at the top level\&. The \&.git directory contains, among other things, a compressed object database representing the complete history of the project, an "index" file which links that history to the current contents of the working tree, and named pointers into that history such as tags and branch heads\&.
.sp
The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which hold file data; trees, which point to blobs and other trees to build up directory hierarchies; and commits, which each reference a single tree and some number of parent commits\&.
.sp
The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or "version", represents a step in the project\(cqs history, and each parent represents an immediately preceding step\&. Commits with more than one parent represent merges of independent lines of development\&.
.sp
All objects are named by the SHA\-1 hash of their contents, normally written as a string of 40 hex digits\&. Such names are globally unique\&. The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched for by signing just that commit\&. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this purpose\&.
.sp
When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for efficiency may later be compressed together into "pack files"\&.
.sp
Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history\&. A ref may contain the SHA\-1 name of an object or the name of another ref (the latter is called a "symbolic ref")\&. Refs with names beginning \fBrefs/head/\fR contain the SHA\-1 name of the most recent commit (or "head") of a branch under development\&. SHA\-1 names of tags of interest are stored under \fBrefs/tags/\fR\&. A symbolic ref named \fBHEAD\fR contains the name of the currently checked\-out branch\&.
.sp
The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each path, a blob object and a set of attributes\&. The blob object represents the contents of the file as of the head of the current branch\&. The attributes (last modified time, size, etc\&.) are taken from the corresponding file in the working tree\&. Subsequent changes to the working tree can be found by comparing these attributes\&. The index may be updated with new content, and new commits may be created from the content stored in the index\&.
.sp
The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages") for a given pathname\&. These stages are used to hold the various unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress\&.
.SH "SECURITY"
.sp
Some configuration options and hook files may cause Git to run arbitrary shell commands\&. Because configuration and hooks are not copied using \fBgit clone\fR, it is generally safe to clone remote repositories with untrusted content, inspect them with \fBgit log\fR, and so on\&.
.sp
However, it is not safe to run Git commands in a \fB\&.git\fR directory (or the working tree that surrounds it) when that \fB\&.git\fR directory itself comes from an untrusted source\&. The commands in its config and hooks are executed in the usual way\&.
.sp
By default, Git will refuse to run when the repository is owned by someone other than the user running the command\&. See the entry for \fBsafe\&.directory\fR in \fBgit-config\fR(1)\&. While this can help protect you in a multi\-user environment, note that you can also acquire untrusted repositories that are owned by you (for example, if you extract a zip file or tarball from an untrusted source)\&. In such cases, you\(cqd need to "sanitize" the untrusted repository first\&.
.sp
If you have an untrusted \fB\&.git\fR directory, you should first clone it with \fBgit clone \-\-no\-local\fR to obtain a clean copy\&. Git does restrict the set of options and hooks that will be run by \fBupload\-pack\fR, which handles the server side of a clone or fetch, but beware that the surface area for attack against \fBupload\-pack\fR is large, so this does carry some risk\&. The safest thing is to serve the repository as an unprivileged user (either via \fBgit-daemon\fR(1), ssh, or using other tools to change user ids)\&. See the discussion in the \fBSECURITY\fR section of \fBgit-upload-pack\fR(1)\&.
