.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory\&. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit\&.
.sp
The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with git stash list, inspected with git stash show, and restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with git stash apply\&. Calling git stash without any arguments is equivalent to git stash save\&. A stash is by default listed as "WIP on \fIbranchname\fR \&...", but you can give a more descriptive message on the command line when you create one\&.
.sp
The latest stash you created is stored in refs/stash; older stashes are found in the reflog of this reference and can be named using the usual reflog syntax (e\&.g\&. stash@{0} is the most recently created stash, stash@{1} is the one before it, stash@{2\&.hours\&.ago} is also possible)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
save [\-p|\-\-patch] [\-k|\-\-[no\-]keep\-index] [\-u|\-\-include\-untracked] [\-a|\-\-all] [\-q|\-\-quiet] [<message>]
.RS 4
Save your local modifications to a new
\fIstash\fR, and run
git reset \-\-hard
to revert them\&. The <message> part is optional and gives the description along with the stashed state\&. For quickly making a snapshot, you can omit
\fIboth\fR
"save" and <message>, but giving only <message> does not trigger this action to prevent a misspelled subcommand from making an unwanted stash\&.
.sp
If the
\-\-keep\-index
option is used, all changes already added to the index are left intact\&.
.sp
If the
\-\-include\-untracked
option is used, all untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned up with
git clean, leaving the working directory in a very clean state\&. If the
\-\-all
option is used instead then the ignored files are stashed and cleaned in addition to the untracked files\&.
.sp
With
\-\-patch, you can interactively select hunks from the diff between HEAD and the working tree to be stashed\&. The stash entry is constructed such that its index state is the same as the index state of your repository, and its worktree contains only the changes you selected interactively\&. The selected changes are then rolled back from your worktree\&. See the \(lqInteractive Mode\(rq section of
\fBgit-add\fR(1)
to learn how to operate the
\-\-patch
mode\&.
.sp
The
\-\-patch
option implies
\-\-keep\-index\&. You can use
\-\-no\-keep\-index
to override this\&.
.RE
.PP
list [<options>]
.RS 4
List the stashes that you currently have\&. Each
\fIstash\fR
is listed with its name (e\&.g\&.
stash@{0}
is the latest stash,
stash@{1}
is the one before, etc\&.), the name of the branch that was current when the stash was made, and a short description of the commit the stash was based on\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
stash@{0}: WIP on submit: 6ebd0e2\&.\&.\&. Update git\-stash documentation
stash@{1}: On master: 9cc0589\&.\&.\&. Add git\-stash
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The command takes options applicable to the
\fIgit log\fR
command to control what is shown and how\&. See
\fBgit-log\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
show [<stash>]
.RS 4
Show the changes recorded in the stash as a diff between the stashed state and its original parent\&. When no
<stash>
is given, shows the latest one\&. By default, the command shows the diffstat, but it will accept any format known to
\fIgit diff\fR
(e\&.g\&.,
git stash show \-p stash@{1}
to view the second most recent stash in patch form)\&.
.RE
.PP
pop [\-\-index] [\-q|\-\-quiet] [<stash>]
.RS 4
Remove a single stashed state from the stash list and apply it on top of the current working tree state, i\&.e\&., do the inverse operation of
git stash save\&. The working directory must match the index\&.
.sp
Applying the state can fail with conflicts; in this case, it is not removed from the stash list\&. You need to resolve the conflicts by hand and call
git stash drop
manually afterwards\&.
.sp
If the
\-\-index
option is used, then tries to reinstate not only the working tree\(cqs changes, but also the index\(cqs ones\&. However, this can fail, when you have conflicts (which are stored in the index, where you therefore can no longer apply the changes as they were originally)\&.
.sp
When no
<stash>
is given,
stash@{0}
is assumed, otherwise
<stash>
must be a reference of the form
stash@{<revision>}\&.
.RE
.PP
apply [\-\-index] [\-q|\-\-quiet] [<stash>]
.RS 4
Like
pop, but do not remove the state from the stash list\&. Unlike
pop,
<stash>
may be any commit that looks like a commit created by
stash save
or
stash create\&.
.RE
.PP
branch <branchname> [<stash>]
.RS 4
Creates and checks out a new branch named
<branchname>
starting from the commit at which the
<stash>
was originally created, applies the changes recorded in
<stash>
to the new working tree and index\&. If that succeeds, and
<stash>
is a reference of the form
stash@{<revision>}, it then drops the
<stash>\&. When no
<stash>
is given, applies the latest one\&.
.sp
This is useful if the branch on which you ran
git stash save
has changed enough that
git stash apply
fails due to conflicts\&. Since the stash is applied on top of the commit that was HEAD at the time
git stash
was run, it restores the originally stashed state with no conflicts\&.
.RE
.PP
clear
.RS 4
Remove all the stashed states\&. Note that those states will then be subject to pruning, and may be impossible to recover (see
\fIExamples\fR
below for a possible strategy)\&.
.RE
.PP
drop [\-q|\-\-quiet] [<stash>]
.RS 4
Remove a single stashed state from the stash list\&. When no
<stash>
is given, it removes the latest one\&. i\&.e\&.
stash@{0}, otherwise
<stash>
must be a valid stash log reference of the form
stash@{<revision>}\&.
.RE
.PP
create
.RS 4
Create a stash (which is a regular commit object) and return its object name, without storing it anywhere in the ref namespace\&. This is intended to be useful for scripts\&. It is probably not the command you want to use; see "save" above\&.
.RE
.PP
store
.RS 4
Store a given stash created via
\fIgit stash create\fR
(which is a dangling merge commit) in the stash ref, updating the stash reflog\&. This is intended to be useful for scripts\&. It is probably not the command you want to use; see "save" above\&.
.RE
.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
A stash is represented as a commit whose tree records the state of the working directory, and its first parent is the commit at HEAD when the stash was created\&. The tree of the second parent records the state of the index when the stash is made, and it is made a child of the HEAD commit\&. The ancestry graph looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
       \&.\-\-\-\-W
      /    /
\-\-\-\-\-H\-\-\-\-I
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
where H is the HEAD commit, I is a commit that records the state of the index, and W is a commit that records the state of the working tree\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Pulling into a dirty tree
.RS 4
When you are in the middle of something, you learn that there are upstream changes that are possibly relevant to what you are doing\&. When your local changes do not conflict with the changes in the upstream, a simple
git pull
will let you move forward\&.
.sp
However, there are cases in which your local changes do conflict with the upstream changes, and
git pull
refuses to overwrite your changes\&. In such a case, you can stash your changes away, perform a pull, and then unstash, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git pull
 \&.\&.\&.
file foobar not up to date, cannot merge\&.
$ git stash
$ git pull
$ git stash pop
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.RE
.PP
Interrupted workflow
.RS 4
When you are in the middle of something, your boss comes in and demands that you fix something immediately\&. Traditionally, you would make a commit to a temporary branch to store your changes away, and return to your original branch to make the emergency fix, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# \&.\&.\&. hack hack hack \&.\&.\&.
$ git checkout \-b my_wip
$ git commit \-a \-m "WIP"
$ git checkout master
$ edit emergency fix
$ git commit \-a \-m "Fix in a hurry"
$ git checkout my_wip
$ git reset \-\-soft HEAD^
# \&.\&.\&. continue hacking \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You can use
\fIgit stash\fR
to simplify the above, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# \&.\&.\&. hack hack hack \&.\&.\&.
$ git stash
$ edit emergency fix
$ git commit \-a \-m "Fix in a hurry"
$ git stash pop
# \&.\&.\&. continue hacking \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.RE
.PP
Testing partial commits
.RS 4
You can use
git stash save \-\-keep\-index
when you want to make two or more commits out of the changes in the work tree, and you want to test each change before committing:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# \&.\&.\&. hack hack hack \&.\&.\&.
$ git add \-\-patch foo            # add just first part to the index
$ git stash save \-\-keep\-index    # save all other changes to the stash
$ edit/build/test first part
$ git commit \-m \(aqFirst part\(aq     # commit fully tested change
$ git stash pop                  # prepare to work on all other changes
# \&.\&.\&. repeat above five steps until one commit remains \&.\&.\&.
$ edit/build/test remaining parts
$ git commit foo \-m \(aqRemaining parts\(aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.RE
.PP
Recovering stashes that were cleared/dropped erroneously
.RS 4
If you mistakenly drop or clear stashes, they cannot be recovered through the normal safety mechanisms\&. However, you can try the following incantation to get a list of stashes that are still in your repository, but not reachable any more:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git fsck \-\-unreachable |
grep commit | cut \-d\e  \-f3 |
xargs git log \-\-merges \-\-no\-walk \-\-grep=WIP
