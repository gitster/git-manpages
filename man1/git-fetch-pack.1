.SH "NAME"
git-fetch-pack \- Receive missing objects from another repository

\fIgit fetch\-pack\fR [\-\-all] [\-\-quiet|\-q] [\-\-keep|\-k] [\-\-thin] [\-\-include\-tag]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Usually you would want to use \fIgit fetch\fR, which is a higher level wrapper of this command, instead\&.
.sp
Invokes \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR on a possibly remote repository and asks it to send objects missing from this repository, to update the named heads\&. The list of commits available locally is found out by scanning the local refs/ hierarchy and sent to \fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR running on the other end\&.
.sp
This command degenerates to download everything to complete the asked refs from the remote side when the local side does not have a common ancestor commit\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
Fetch all remote refs\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stdin
.RS 4
Take the list of refs from stdin, one per line\&. If there are refs specified on the command line in addition to this option, then the refs from stdin are processed after those on the command line\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-\-stateless\-rpc\fR
is specified together with this option then the list of refs must be in packet format (pkt\-line)\&. Each ref must be in a separate packet, and the list must end with a flush packet\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
Pass
\fB\-q\fR
flag to
\fIgit unpack\-objects\fR; this makes the cloning process less verbose\&.
.RE
.PP
\-k, \-\-keep
.RS 4
Do not invoke
\fIgit unpack\-objects\fR
on received data, but create a single packfile out of it instead, and store it in the object database\&. If provided twice then the pack is locked against repacking\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-thin
.RS 4
Fetch a "thin" pack, which records objects in deltified form based on objects not included in the pack to reduce network traffic\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-include\-tag
.RS 4
If the remote side supports it, annotated tags objects will be downloaded on the same connection as the other objects if the object the tag references is downloaded\&. The caller must otherwise determine the tags this option made available\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-upload\-pack=<git\-upload\-pack>
.RS 4
Use this to specify the path to
\fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR
on the remote side, if it is not found on your $PATH\&. Installations of sshd ignores the user\(cqs environment setup scripts for login shells (e\&.g\&. \&.bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be found on the system default $PATH\&. Another workaround suggested is to set up your $PATH in "\&.bashrc", but this flag is for people who do not want to pay the overhead for non\-interactive shells by having a lean \&.bashrc file (they set most of the things up in \&.bash_profile)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exec=<git\-upload\-pack>
.RS 4
Same as \-\-upload\-pack=<git\-upload\-pack>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-depth=<n>
.RS 4
Limit fetching to ancestor\-chains not longer than n\&.
\fIgit\-upload\-pack\fR
treats the special depth 2147483647 as infinite even if there is an ancestor\-chain that long\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-shallow\-since=<date>
.RS 4
Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to include all reachable commits after <date>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-shallow\-exclude=<revision>
.RS 4
Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag\&. This option can be specified multiple times\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-deepen\-relative
.RS 4
Argument \-\-depth specifies the number of commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each remote branch history\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-refetch
.RS 4
Skips negotiating commits with the server in order to fetch all matching objects\&. Use to reapply a new partial clone blob/tree filter\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-progress
.RS 4
Do not show the progress\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-check\-self\-contained\-and\-connected
.RS 4
Output "connectivity\-ok" if the received pack is self\-contained and connected\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Run verbosely\&.
.RE
.PP
<repository>
.RS 4
The URL to the remote repository\&.
.RE
.PP
<refs>\&...
.RS 4
The remote heads to update from\&. This is relative to $GIT_DIR (e\&.g\&. "HEAD", "refs/heads/master")\&. When unspecified, update from all heads the remote side has\&.
.sp
If the remote has enabled the options
\fBuploadpack\&.allowTipSHA1InWant\fR,
\fBuploadpack\&.allowReachableSHA1InWant\fR, or
\fBuploadpack\&.allowAnySHA1InWant\fR, they may alternatively be 40\-hex sha1s present on the remote\&.
.RE
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.sp
\fBgit-fetch\fR(1)
.SH "GIT"
.sp
Part of the \fBgit\fR(1) suite
