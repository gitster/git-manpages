.SH "NAME"
git-mergetool \- Run merge conflict resolution tools to resolve merge conflicts
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit mergetool\fR [\-\-tool=<tool>] [\-y | \-\-[no\-]prompt] [<file>\&...]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Use \fBgit mergetool\fR to run one of several merge utilities to resolve merge conflicts\&. It is typically run after \fIgit merge\fR\&.
.sp
If one or more <file> parameters are given, the merge tool program will be run to resolve differences in each file (skipping those without conflicts)\&. Specifying a directory will include all unresolved files in that path\&. If no <file> names are specified, \fIgit mergetool\fR will run the merge tool program on every file with merge conflicts\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-t <tool>, \-\-tool=<tool>
.RS 4
Use the merge resolution program specified by <tool>\&. Valid values include emerge, gvimdiff, kdiff3, meld, vimdiff, and tortoisemerge\&. Run
\fBgit mergetool \-\-tool\-help\fR
for the list of valid <tool> settings\&.
.sp
If a merge resolution program is not specified,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
will use the configuration variable
\fBmerge\&.tool\fR\&. If the configuration variable
\fBmerge\&.tool\fR
is not set,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
will pick a suitable default\&.
.sp
You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting the configuration variable
\fBmergetool\&.<tool>\&.path\fR\&. For example, you can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting
\fBmergetool\&.kdiff3\&.path\fR\&. Otherwise,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
assumes the tool is available in PATH\&.
.sp
Instead of running one of the known merge tool programs,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
can be customized to run an alternative program by specifying the command line to invoke in a configuration variable
\fBmergetool\&.<tool>\&.cmd\fR\&.
.sp
When
\fIgit mergetool\fR
is invoked with this tool (either through the
\fB\-t\fR
or
\fB\-\-tool\fR
option or the
\fBmerge\&.tool\fR
configuration variable), the configured command line will be invoked with
\fB$BASE\fR
set to the name of a temporary file containing the common base for the merge, if available;
\fB$LOCAL\fR
set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file on the current branch;
\fB$REMOTE\fR
set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file to be merged, and
\fB$MERGED\fR
set to the name of the file to which the merge tool should write the result of the merge resolution\&.
.sp
If the custom merge tool correctly indicates the success of a merge resolution with its exit code, then the configuration variable
\fBmergetool\&.<tool>\&.trustExitCode\fR
can be set to
\fBtrue\fR\&. Otherwise,
\fIgit mergetool\fR
will prompt the user to indicate the success of the resolution after the custom tool has exited\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-tool\-help
.RS 4
Print a list of merge tools that may be used with
\fB\-\-tool\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-y, \-\-no\-prompt
.RS 4
Don\(cqt prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution program\&. This is the default if the merge resolution program is explicitly specified with the
\fB\-\-tool\fR
option or with the
\fBmerge\&.tool\fR
configuration variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-prompt
.RS 4
Prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution program to give the user a chance to skip the path\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g, \-\-gui
.RS 4
When
\fIgit\-mergetool\fR
is invoked with the
\fB\-g\fR
or
\fB\-\-gui\fR
option, the default merge tool will be read from the configured
\fBmerge\&.guitool\fR
variable instead of
\fBmerge\&.tool\fR\&. If
\fBmerge\&.guitool\fR
is not set, we will fallback to the tool configured under
\fBmerge\&.tool\fR\&. This may be autoselected using the configuration variable
\fBmergetool\&.guiDefault\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-gui
.RS 4
This overrides a previous
\fB\-g\fR
or
\fB\-\-gui\fR
setting or
\fBmergetool\&.guiDefault\fR
configuration and reads the default merge tool from the configured
\fBmerge\&.tool\fR
variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\-O<orderfile>
.RS 4
Process files in the order specified in the <orderfile>, which has one shell glob pattern per line\&. This overrides the
\fBdiff\&.orderFile\fR
configuration variable (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. To cancel
\fBdiff\&.orderFile\fR, use
\fB\-O/dev/null\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the \fBgit-config\fR(1) documentation\&. The content is the same as what\(cqs found there:
.PP
mergetool\&.<tool>\&.path
.RS 4
Override the path for the given tool\&. This is useful in case your tool is not in the PATH\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.<tool>\&.cmd
.RS 4
Specify the command to invoke the specified merge tool\&. The specified command is evaluated in shell with the following variables available:
\fIBASE\fR
is the name of a temporary file containing the common base of the files to be merged, if available;
\fILOCAL\fR
is the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file on the current branch;
\fIREMOTE\fR
is the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file from the branch being merged;
\fIMERGED\fR
contains the name of the file to which the merge tool should write the results of a successful merge\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.<tool>\&.hideResolved
.RS 4
Allows the user to override the global
\fBmergetool\&.hideResolved\fR
value for a specific tool\&. See
\fBmergetool\&.hideResolved\fR
for the full description\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.<tool>\&.trustExitCode
.RS 4
For a custom merge command, specify whether the exit code of the merge command can be used to determine whether the merge was successful\&. If this is not set to true then the merge target file timestamp is checked, and the merge is assumed to have been successful if the file has been updated; otherwise, the user is prompted to indicate the success of the merge\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.meld\&.hasOutput
.RS 4
Older versions of
\fBmeld\fR
do not support the
\fB\-\-output\fR
option\&. Git will attempt to detect whether
\fBmeld\fR
supports
\fB\-\-output\fR
by inspecting the output of
\fBmeld \-\-help\fR\&. Configuring
\fBmergetool\&.meld\&.hasOutput\fR
will make Git skip these checks and use the configured value instead\&. Setting
\fBmergetool\&.meld\&.hasOutput\fR
to
\fBtrue\fR
tells Git to unconditionally use the
\fB\-\-output\fR
option, and
\fBfalse\fR
avoids using
\fB\-\-output\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.meld\&.useAutoMerge
.RS 4
When the
\fB\-\-auto\-merge\fR
is given, meld will merge all non\-conflicting parts automatically, highlight the conflicting parts, and wait for user decision\&. Setting
\fBmergetool\&.meld\&.useAutoMerge\fR
to
\fBtrue\fR
tells Git to unconditionally use the
\fB\-\-auto\-merge\fR
option with
\fBmeld\fR\&. Setting this value to
\fBauto\fR
makes git detect whether
\fB\-\-auto\-merge\fR
is supported and will only use
\fB\-\-auto\-merge\fR
when available\&. A value of
\fBfalse\fR
avoids using
\fB\-\-auto\-merge\fR
altogether, and is the default value\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.<vimdiff variant>\&.layout
.RS 4
Configure the split window layout for vimdiff\(cqs
\fB<variant>\fR, which is any of
\fBvimdiff\fR,
\fBnvimdiff\fR,
\fBgvimdiff\fR\&. Upon launching
\fBgit mergetool\fR
with
\fB\-\-tool=<variant>\fR
(or without
\fB\-\-tool\fR
if
\fBmerge\&.tool\fR
is configured as
\fB<variant>\fR), Git will consult
\fBmergetool\&.<variant>\&.layout\fR
to determine the tool\(cqs layout\&. If the variant\-specific configuration is not available,
\fBvimdiff\fR\*(Aqs is used as fallback\&. If that too is not available, a default layout with 4 windows will be used\&. To configure the layout, see the
\fBBACKEND SPECIFIC HINTS\fR
section\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.hideResolved
.RS 4
During a merge, Git will automatically resolve as many conflicts as possible and write the
\fIMERGED\fR
file containing conflict markers around any conflicts that it cannot resolve;
\fILOCAL\fR
and
\fIREMOTE\fR
normally represent the versions of the file from before Git\(cqs conflict resolution\&. This flag causes
\fILOCAL\fR
and
\fIREMOTE\fR
to be overwritten so that only the unresolved conflicts are presented to the merge tool\&. Can be configured per\-tool via the
\fBmergetool\&.<tool>\&.hideResolved\fR
configuration variable\&. Defaults to
\fBfalse\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.keepBackup
.RS 4
After performing a merge, the original file with conflict markers can be saved as a file with a
\fB\&.orig\fR
extension\&. If this variable is set to
\fBfalse\fR
then this file is not preserved\&. Defaults to
\fBtrue\fR
(i\&.e\&. keep the backup files)\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.keepTemporaries
.RS 4
When invoking a custom merge tool, Git uses a set of temporary files to pass to the tool\&. If the tool returns an error and this variable is set to
\fBtrue\fR, then these temporary files will be preserved; otherwise, they will be removed after the tool has exited\&. Defaults to
\fBfalse\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.writeToTemp
.RS 4
Git writes temporary
\fIBASE\fR,
\fILOCAL\fR, and
\fIREMOTE\fR
versions of conflicting files in the worktree by default\&. Git will attempt to use a temporary directory for these files when set
\fBtrue\fR\&. Defaults to
\fBfalse\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.prompt
.RS 4
Prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution program\&.
.RE
.PP
mergetool\&.guiDefault
.RS 4
Set
\fBtrue\fR
to use the
\fBmerge\&.guitool\fR
by default (equivalent to specifying the
\fB\-\-gui\fR
argument), or
\fBauto\fR
to select
\fBmerge\&.guitool\fR
or
\fBmerge\&.tool\fR
depending on the presence of a
\fBDISPLAY\fR
environment variable value\&. The default is
\fBfalse\fR, where the
\fB\-\-gui\fR
argument must be provided explicitly for the
\fBmerge\&.guitool\fR
to be used\&.
.RE
.SH "TEMPORARY FILES"
.sp
\fBgit mergetool\fR creates \fB*\&.orig\fR backup files while resolving merges\&. These are safe to remove once a file has been merged and its \fBgit mergetool\fR session has completed\&.
.sp
Setting the \fBmergetool\&.keepBackup\fR configuration variable to \fBfalse\fR causes \fBgit mergetool\fR to automatically remove the backup files as files are successfully merged\&.

\fBLOCAL\fR, \fBBASE\fR and \fBREMOTE\fR are read\-only buffers showing the contents of the conflicting file in specific commits ("commit you are merging into", "common ancestor commit" and "commit you are merging from" respectively)
.sp
\fBMERGED\fR is a writable buffer where you have to resolve the conflicts (using the other read\-only buffers as a reference)\&. Once you are done, save and exit Vim as usual (\fB:wq\fR) or, if you want to abort, exit using \fB:cq\fR\&.

The precedence of the operators is as follows (you can use parentheses to change it):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
`@` > `+` > `/` > `,`
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
Let\(cqs see some examples to understand how it works:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBlayout = "(LOCAL,BASE,REMOTE)/MERGED"\fR
.sp
This is exactly the same as the default layout we have already seen\&.
.sp
Note that
\fB/\fR
has precedence over
\fB,\fR
and thus the parenthesis are not needed in this case\&. The next layout definition is equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\

Note how in the third tab definition we need to use parentheses to make
\fB,\fR
have precedence over

Instead of \fB\-\-tool=vimdiff\fR, you can also use one of these other variants:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fB\-\-tool=gvimdiff\fR, to open gVim instead of Vim\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fB\-\-tool=nvimdiff\fR, to open Neovim instead of Vim\&.
.RE
.sp
When using these variants, in order to specify a custom layout you will have to set configuration variables \fBmergetool\&.gvimdiff\&.layout\fR and \fBmergetool\&.nvimdiff\&.layout\fR instead of \fBmergetool\&.vimdiff\&.layout\fR (though the latter will be used as fallback if the variant\-specific one is not set)\&.
.sp
In addition, for backwards compatibility with previous Git versions, you can also append \fB1\fR, \fB2\fR or \fB3\fR to either \fBvimdiff\fR or any of the variants (ex: \fBvimdiff3\fR, \fBnvimdiff1\fR, etc\&...) to use a predefined layout\&. In other words, using \fB\-\-tool=[g,n,]vimdiffx\fR is the same as using \fB\-\-tool=[g,n,]vimdiff\fR and setting configuration variable \fBmergetool\&.[g,n,]vimdiff\&.layout\fR to\&...
