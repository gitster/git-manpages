.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command\&. The name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped\&.
.sp
Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the \fB\-\-append\fR option\&. If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple lines, a \fBvalue\-pattern\fR (which is an extended regular expression, unless the \fB\-\-fixed\-value\fR option is given) needs to be given\&. Only the existing values that match the pattern are updated or unset\&. If you want to handle the lines that do \fBnot\fR match the pattern, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see also the section called \(lqEXAMPLES\(rq), but note that this only works when the \fB\-\-fixed\-value\fR option is not in use\&.
.sp
The \fB\-\-type=<type>\fR option instructs \fIgit config\fR to ensure that incoming and outgoing values are canonicalize\-able under the given <type>\&. If no \fB\-\-type=<type>\fR is given, no canonicalization will be performed\&. Callers may unset an existing \fB\-\-type\fR specifier with \fB\-\-no\-type\fR\&.
.sp
When reading, the values are read from the system, global and repository local configuration files by default, and options \fB\-\-system\fR, \fB\-\-global\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR, \fB\-\-worktree\fR and \fB\-\-file <filename>\fR can be used to tell the command to read from only that location (see the section called \(lqFILES\(rq)\&.
.sp
When writing, the new value is written to the repository local configuration file by default, and options \fB\-\-system\fR, \fB\-\-global\fR, \fB\-\-worktree\fR, \fB\-\-file <filename>\fR can be used to tell the command to write to that location (you can say \fB\-\-local\fR but that is the default)\&.

A list of all available configuration variables can be obtained using the \fBgit help \-\-config\fR command\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
list
.RS 4
List all variables set in config file, along with their values\&.
.RE
.PP
get
.RS 4
Emits the value of the specified key\&. If key is present multiple times in the configuration, emits the last value\&. If
\fB\-\-all\fR
is specified, emits all values associated with key\&. Returns error code 1 if key is not present\&.
.RE
.PP
set
.RS 4
Set value for one or more config options\&. By default, this command refuses to write multi\-valued config options\&. Passing
\fB\-\-all\fR
will replace all multi\-valued config options with the new value, whereas
\fB\-\-value=\fR
will replace all config options whose values match the given pattern\&.
.RE
.PP
unset
.RS 4
Unset value for one or more config options\&. By default, this command refuses to unset multi\-valued keys\&. Passing
\fB\-\-all\fR
will unset all multi\-valued config options, whereas
\fB\-\-value\fR
will unset all config options whose values match the given pattern\&.
.RE
.PP
rename\-section
.RS 4
Rename the given section to a new name\&.
.RE
.PP
remove\-section
.RS 4
Remove the given section from the configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
edit
.RS 4
Opens an editor to modify the specified config file; either
\fB\-\-system\fR,
\fB\-\-global\fR,
\fB\-\-local\fR
(default),
\fB\-\-worktree\fR, or
\fB\-\-file <config\-file>\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-replace\-all
.RS 4
Default behavior is to replace at most one line\&. This replaces all lines matching the key (and optionally the
\fBvalue\-pattern\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-append
.RS 4
Adds a new line to the option without altering any existing values\&. This is the same as providing
\fI\-\-value=^$\fR
in
\fBset\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-comment <message>
.RS 4
Append a comment at the end of new or modified lines\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
If _<message>_ begins with one or more whitespaces followed
by "#", it is used as\-is\&.  If it begins with "#", a space is
prepended before it is used\&.  Otherwise, a string " # " (a
space followed by a hash followed by a space) is prepended
to it\&.  And the resulting string is placed immediately after
the value defined for the variable\&.  The _<message>_ must
not contain linefeed characters (no multi\-line comments are
permitted)\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.RE
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
With
\fBget\fR, return all values for a multi\-valued key\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-\-regexp
.RS 4
With
\fBget\fR, interpret the name as a regular expression\&. Regular expression matching is currently case\-sensitive and done against a canonicalized version of the key in which section and variable names are lowercased, but subsection names are not\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-url=<URL>
.RS 4
When given a two\-part <name> as <section>\&.<key>, the value for <section>\&.<URL>\&.<key> whose <URL> part matches the best to the given URL is returned (if no such key exists, the value for <section>\&.<key> is used as a fallback)\&. When given just the <section> as name, do so for all the keys in the section and list them\&. Returns error code 1 if no value is found\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-global
.RS 4
For writing options: write to global
\fB~/\&.gitconfig\fR
file rather than the repository
\fB\&.git/config\fR, write to
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config\fR

.sp
You may also provide additional configuration parameters when running any git command by using the \fB\-c\fR option\&. See \fBgit\fR(1) for details\&.
.sp
Options will be read from all of these files that are available\&. If the global or the system\-wide configuration files are missing or unreadable they will be ignored\&. If the repository configuration file is missing or unreadable, \fIgit config\fR will exit with a non\-zero error code\&. An error message is produced if the file is unreadable, but not if it is missing\&.
.sp
The files are read in the order given above, with last value found taking precedence over values read earlier\&. When multiple values are taken then all values of a key from all files will be used\&.
.sp
By default, options are only written to the repository specific configuration file\&. Note that this also affects options like \fBset\fR and \fBunset\fR\&. \fB\fIgit config\fR\fR\fB will only ever change one file at a time\fR\&.
.sp
You can limit which configuration sources are read from or written to by specifying the path of a file with the \fB\-\-file\fR option, or by specifying a configuration scope with \fB\-\-system\fR, \fB\-\-global\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR, or \fB\-\-worktree\fR\&.

With the exception of \fIcommand\fR, each scope corresponds to a command line option: \fB\-\-system\fR, \fB\-\-global\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR, \fB\-\-worktree\fR\&.
.sp
When reading options, specifying a scope will only read options from the files within that scope\&. When writing options, specifying a scope will write to the files within that scope (instead of the repository specific configuration file)\&. See the section called \(lqOPTIONS\(rq above for a complete description\&.
.sp
Most configuration options are respected regardless of the scope it is defined in, but some options are only respected in certain scopes\&. See the respective option\(cqs documentation for the full details\&.
.SS "Protected configuration"
.sp
Protected configuration refers to the \fIsystem\fR, \fIglobal\fR, and \fIcommand\fR scopes\&. For security reasons, certain options are only respected when they are specified in protected configuration, and ignored otherwise\&.
.sp
Git treats these scopes as if they are controlled by the user or a trusted administrator\&. This is because an attacker who controls these scopes can do substantial harm without using Git, so it is assumed that the user\(cqs environment protects these scopes against attackers\&.

The config pairs are zero\-indexed\&. Any missing key or value is treated as an error\&. An empty GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is treated the same as GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=0, namely no pairs are processed\&. These environment variables will override values in configuration files, but will be overridden by any explicit options passed via
\fBgit \-c\fR\&.

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
.sp
The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect the Git commands\*(Aq behavior\&. The files \fB\&.git/config\fR and optionally \fBconfig\&.worktree\fR (see the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of \fBgit-worktree\fR(1)) in each repository are used to store the configuration for that repository, and \fB$HOME/\&.gitconfig\fR is used to store a per\-user configuration as fallback values for the \fB\&.git/config\fR file\&. The file \fB/etc/gitconfig\fR can be used to store a system\-wide default configuration\&.
.sp
The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing and the porcelain commands\&. The variables are divided into sections, wherein the fully qualified variable name of the variable itself is the last dot\-separated segment and the section name is everything before the last dot\&. The variable names are case\-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and \fB\-\fR, and must start with an alphabetic character\&. Some variables may appear multiple times; we say then that the variable is multivalued\&.
.SS "Syntax"
.sp
The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive\&. Whitespace characters, which in this context are the space character (SP) and the horizontal tabulation (HT), are mostly ignored\&. The \fI#\fR and \fI;\fR characters begin comments to the end of line\&. Blank lines are ignored\&.
.sp
The file consists of sections and variables\&. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins\&. Section names are case\-insensitive\&. Only alphanumeric characters, \fB\-\fR and \fB\&.\fR are allowed in section names\&. Each variable must belong to some section, which means that there must be a section header before the first setting of a variable\&.
.sp
Sections can be further divided into subsections\&. To begin a subsection put its name in double quotes, separated by space from the section name, in the section header, like in the example below:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        [section "subsection"]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters except newline and the null byte\&. Doublequote \fB"\fR and backslash can be included by escaping them as \fB\e"\fR and \fB\e\e\fR, respectively\&. Backslashes preceding other characters are dropped when reading; for example, \fB\et\fR is read as \fBt\fR and \fB\e0\fR is read as \fB0\fR\&. Section headers cannot span multiple lines\&. Variables may belong directly to a section or to a given subsection\&. You can have \fB[section]\fR if you have \fB[section "subsection"]\fR, but you don\(cqt need to\&.
.sp
There is also a deprecated \fB[section\&.subsection]\fR syntax\&. With this syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower\-case and is also compared case sensitively\&. These subsection names follow the same restrictions as section names\&.
.sp
All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form \fIname = value\fR (or just \fIname\fR, which is a short\-hand to say that the variable is the boolean "true")\&. The variable names are case\-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and \fB\-\fR, and must start with an alphabetic character\&.
.sp
Whitespace characters surrounding \fBname\fR, \fB=\fR and \fBvalue\fR are discarded\&. Internal whitespace characters within \fIvalue\fR are retained verbatim\&. Comments starting with either \fB#\fR or \fB;\fR and extending to the end of line are discarded\&. A line that defines a value can be continued to the next line by ending it with a backslash (\fB\e\fR); the backslash and the end\-of\-line characters are discarded\&.
.sp
If \fBvalue\fR needs to contain leading or trailing whitespace characters, it must be enclosed in double quotation marks (\fB"\fR)\&. Inside double quotation marks, double quote (\fB"\fR) and backslash (\fB\e\fR) characters must be escaped: use \fB\e"\fR for \fB"\fR and \fB\e\e\fR for \fB\e\fR\&.
.sp
The following escape sequences (beside \fB\e"\fR and \fB\e\e\fR) are recognized: \fB\en\fR for newline character (NL), \fB\et\fR for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB) and \fB\eb\fR for backspace (BS)\&. Other char escape sequences (including octal escape sequences) are invalid\&.
.SS "Includes"
.sp
The \fBinclude\fR and \fBincludeIf\fR sections allow you to include config directives from another source\&. These sections behave identically to each other with the exception that \fBincludeIf\fR sections may be ignored if their condition does not evaluate to true; see "Conditional includes" below\&.
.sp
You can include a config file from another by setting the special \fBinclude\&.path\fR (or \fBincludeIf\&.*\&.path\fR) variable to the name of the file to be included\&. The variable takes a pathname as its value, and is subject to tilde expansion\&. These variables can be given multiple times\&.
.sp
The contents of the included file are inserted immediately, as if they had been found at the location of the include directive\&. If the value of the variable is a relative path, the path is considered to be relative to the configuration file in which the include directive was found\&. See below for examples\&.
.SS "Conditional includes"
.sp
You can conditionally include a config file from another by setting an \fBincludeIf\&.<condition>\&.path\fR variable to the name of the file to be included\&.
.sp
The condition starts with a keyword followed by a colon and some data whose format and meaning depends on the keyword\&. Supported keywords are:
.PP
\fBgitdir\fR
.RS 4
The data that follows the keyword
\fBgitdir:\fR
is used as a glob pattern\&. If the location of the \&.git directory matches the pattern, the include condition is met\&.
.sp
The \&.git location may be auto\-discovered, or come from
\fB$GIT_DIR\fR
environment variable\&. If the repository is auto\-discovered via a \&.git file (e\&.g\&. from submodules, or a linked worktree), the \&.git location would be the final location where the \&.git directory is, not where the \&.git file is\&.
.sp
The pattern can contain standard globbing wildcards and two additional ones,
\fB**/\fR
and
\fB/**\fR, that can match multiple path components\&. Please refer to
\fBgitignore\fR(5)
for details\&. For convenience:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the pattern starts with
\fB~/\fR,
\fB~\fR
will be substituted with the content of the environment variable
\fBHOME\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the pattern starts with
\fB\&./\fR, it is replaced with the directory containing the current config file\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the pattern does not start with either
\fB~/\fR,
\fB\&./\fR
or
\fB/\fR,
\fB**/\fR
will be automatically prepended\&. For example, the pattern
\fBfoo/bar\fR
becomes
\fB**/foo/bar\fR
and would match
\fB/any/path/to/foo/bar\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the pattern ends with
\fB/\fR,
\fB**\fR
will be automatically added\&. For example, the pattern
\fBfoo/\fR
becomes
\fBfoo/**\fR\&. In other words, it matches "foo" and everything inside, recursively\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBgitdir/i\fR
.RS 4
This is the same as
\fBgitdir\fR
except that matching is done case\-insensitively (e\&.g\&. on case\-insensitive file systems)
.RE
.PP
\fBonbranch\fR
.RS 4
The data that follows the keyword
\fBonbranch:\fR
is taken to be a pattern with standard globbing wildcards and two additional ones,
\fB**/\fR
and
\fB/**\fR, that can match multiple path components\&. If we are in a worktree where the name of the branch that is currently checked out matches the pattern, the include condition is met\&.
.sp
If the pattern ends with
\fB/\fR,
\fB**\fR
will be automatically added\&. For example, the pattern
\fBfoo/\fR
becomes
\fBfoo/**\fR\&. In other words, it matches all branches that begin with
\fBfoo/\fR\&. This is useful if your branches are organized hierarchically and you would like to apply a configuration to all the branches in that hierarchy\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhasconfig:remote\&.*\&.url:\fR
.RS 4
The data that follows this keyword is taken to be a pattern with standard globbing wildcards and two additional ones,
\fB**/\fR
and
\fB/**\fR, that can match multiple components\&. The first time this keyword is seen, the rest of the config files will be scanned for remote URLs (without applying any values)\&. If there exists at least one remote URL that matches this pattern, the include condition is met\&.
.sp
Files included by this option (directly or indirectly) are not allowed to contain remote URLs\&.
.sp
Note that unlike other includeIf conditions, resolving this condition relies on information that is not yet known at the point of reading the condition\&. A typical use case is this option being present as a system\-level or global\-level config, and the remote URL being in a local\-level config; hence the need to scan ahead when resolving this condition\&. In order to avoid the chicken\-and\-egg problem in which potentially\-included files can affect whether such files are potentially included, Git breaks the cycle by prohibiting these files from affecting the resolution of these conditions (thus, prohibiting them from declaring remote URLs)\&.
.sp
As for the naming of this keyword, it is for forwards compatibility with a naming scheme that supports more variable\-based include conditions, but currently Git only supports the exact keyword described above\&.
.RE
.sp
A few more notes on matching via \fBgitdir\fR and \fBgitdir/i\fR:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Symlinks in
\fB$GIT_DIR\fR
are not resolved before matching\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Both the symlink & realpath versions of paths will be matched outside of
\fB$GIT_DIR\fR\&. E\&.g\&. if ~/git is a symlink to /mnt/storage/git, both
\fBgitdir:~/git\fR
and
\fBgitdir:/mnt/storage/git\fR
will match\&.
.sp
This was not the case in the initial release of this feature in v2\&.13\&.0, which only matched the realpath version\&. Configuration that wants to be compatible with the initial release of this feature needs to either specify only the realpath version, or both versions\&.

.sp

.SS "Values"

Values of many variables are treated as a simple string, but there are variables that take values of specific types and there are rules as to how to spell them\&.
.PP

.RS 4
When a variable is said to take a boolean value, many synonyms are accepted for
\fItrue\fR
and
\fIfalse\fR; these are all case\-insensitive\&.
.PP
true
.RS 4
Boolean true literals are
\fByes\fR,
\fBon\fR,
\fBtrue\fR, and
\fB1\fR\&. Also, a variable defined without
\fB= <value>\fR
is taken as true\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
Boolean false literals are
\fBno\fR,
\fBoff\fR,
\fBfalse\fR,
\fB0\fR
and the empty string\&.
.sp

\fB\-\-type=bool\fR
type specifier,
\fIgit config\fR
will ensure that the output is "true" or "false" (spelled in lowercase)\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
integer
.RS 4
The value for many variables that specify various sizes can be suffixed with
\fBk\fR,
\fBM\fR,\&... to mean "scale the number by 1024", "by 1024x1024", etc\&.
.RE
.PP
color
.RS 4
The value for a variable that takes a color is a list of colors (at most two, one for foreground and one for background) and attributes (as many as you want), separated by spaces\&.
.sp
The basic colors accepted are
\fBnormal\fR,
\fBblack\fR,
\fBred\fR,
\fBgreen\fR,
\fByellow\fR,
\fBblue\fR,
\fBmagenta\fR,
\fBcyan\fR,
\fBwhite\fR
and
\fBdefault\fR\&. The first color given is the foreground; the second is the background\&. All the basic colors except
\fBnormal\fR
and
\fBdefault\fR
have a bright variant that can be specified by prefixing the color with
\fBbright\fR, like
\fBbrightred\fR\&.
.sp
The color
\fBnormal\fR
makes no change to the color\&. It is the same as an empty string, but can be used as the foreground color when specifying a background color alone (for example, "normal red")\&.
.sp
The color
\fBdefault\fR
explicitly resets the color to the terminal default, for example to specify a cleared background\&. Although it varies between terminals, this is usually not the same as setting to "white black"\&.
.sp
Colors may also be given as numbers between 0 and 255; these use ANSI 256\-color mode (but note that not all terminals may support this)\&. If your terminal supports it, you may also specify 24\-bit RGB values as hex, like
\fB#ff0ab3\fR, or 12\-bit RGB values like
\fB#f1b\fR, which is equivalent to the 24\-bit color
\fB#ff11bb\fR\&.
.sp
The accepted attributes are
\fBbold\fR,
\fBdim\fR,
\fBul\fR,
\fBblink\fR,
\fBreverse\fR,
\fBitalic\fR, and
\fBstrike\fR
(for crossed\-out or "strikethrough" letters)\&. The position of any attributes with respect to the colors (before, after, or in between), doesn\(cqt matter\&. Specific attributes may be turned off by prefixing them with
\fBno\fR
or
\fBno\-\fR
(e\&.g\&.,
\fBnoreverse\fR,
\fBno\-ul\fR, etc)\&.
.sp
The pseudo\-attribute
\fBreset\fR
resets all colors and attributes before applying the specified coloring\&. For example,
\fBreset green\fR
will result in a green foreground and default background without any active attributes\&.
.sp
An empty color string produces no color effect at all\&. This can be used to avoid coloring specific elements without disabling color entirely\&.
.sp
For git\(cqs pre\-defined color slots, the attributes are meant to be reset at the beginning of each item in the colored output\&. So setting
\fBcolor\&.decorate\&.branch\fR
to
\fBblack\fR
will paint that branch name in a plain
\fBblack\fR, even if the previous thing on the same output line (e\&.g\&. opening parenthesis before the list of branch names in
\fBlog \-\-decorate\fR
output) is set to be painted with
\fBbold\fR
or some other attribute\&. However, custom log formats may do more complicated and layered coloring, and the negated forms may be useful there\&.
.RE
.PP
pathname
.RS 4
A variable that takes a pathname value can be given a string that begins with "\fB~/\fR" or "\fB~user/\fR", and the usual tilde expansion happens to such a string:
\fB~/\fR
is expanded to the value of
\fB$HOME\fR, and
\fB~user/\fR
to the specified user\(cqs home directory\&.
.sp
If a path starts with
\fB%(prefix)/\fR, the remainder is interpreted as a path relative to Git\(cqs "runtime prefix", i\&.e\&. relative to the location where Git itself was installed\&. For example,
\fB%(prefix)/bin/\fR
refers to the directory in which the Git executable itself lives\&. If Git was compiled without runtime prefix support, the compiled\-in prefix will be substituted instead\&. In the unlikely event that a literal path needs to be specified that should
\fInot\fR
be expanded, it needs to be prefixed by
\fB\&./\fR, like so:
\fB\&./%(prefix)/bin\fR\&.
.RE

alias\&.*
.RS 4
Command aliases for the
\fBgit\fR(1)
command wrapper \- e\&.g\&. after defining
\fBalias\&.last = cat\-file commit HEAD\fR, the invocation
\fBgit last\fR
is equivalent to
\fBgit cat\-file commit HEAD\fR\&. To avoid confusion and troubles with script usage, aliases that hide existing Git commands are ignored\&. Arguments are split by spaces, the usual shell quoting and escaping are supported\&. A quote pair or a backslash can be used to quote them\&.
.sp
Note that the first word of an alias does not necessarily have to be a command\&. It can be a command\-line option that will be passed into the invocation of
\fBgit\fR\&. In particular, this is useful when used with
\fB\-c\fR
to pass in one\-time configurations or
\fB\-p\fR
to force pagination\&. For example,
\fBloud\-rebase = \-c commit\&.verbose=true rebase\fR
can be defined such that running
\fBgit loud\-rebase\fR
would be equivalent to
\fBgit \-c commit\&.verbose=true rebase\fR\&. Also,
\fBps = \-p status\fR
would be a helpful alias since
\fBgit ps\fR
would paginate the output of
\fBgit status\fR
where the original command does not\&.
.sp
If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it will be treated as a shell command\&. For example, defining
\fBalias\&.new = !gitk \-\-all \-\-not ORIG_HEAD\fR, the invocation
\fBgit new\fR
is equivalent to running the shell command
\fBgitk \-\-all \-\-not ORIG_HEAD\fR\&. Note:

Care should be taken if your shell alias is a "one\-liner" script with multiple commands (e\&.g\&. in a pipeline), references multiple arguments, or is otherwise not able to handle positional arguments added at the end\&. For example:
\fBalias\&.cmd = "!echo $1 | grep $2"\fR

A convenient way to deal with this is to write your script operations in an inline function that is then called with any arguments from the command\-line\&. For example `alias\&.cmd = "!c() { echo $1 | grep $2 ; }; c" will correctly execute the prior example\&.

Within a pseudo\-merge group, commits may be further grouped into sub\-groups based on the capture groups in the pattern\&. These sub\-groupings are formed from the regular expressions by concatenating any capture groups from the regular expression, with a

For example, if the pattern is
\fBrefs/tags/\fR, then all tags (provided they meet the below criteria) will be considered candidates for the same pseudo\-merge group\&. However, if the pattern is instead

Setting this threshold to a smaller value (e\&.g\&., 1\&.week\&.ago) will cause more stable groups to be generated (which impose a one\-time generation cost) but those groups will likely become stale over time\&.

Note that if you concurrently use multiple versions of Git, such as one version on the command line and another version in an IDE tool, that the definition of

Git versions prior to 2\&.26 default to hook protocol V1 and will silently assume there were no changes to report (no scan), so status commands may report incomplete results\&.

core\&.safecrlf
.RS 4
If true, makes Git check if converting
\fBCRLF\fR
is reversible when end\-of\-line conversion is active\&. Git will verify if a command modifies a file in the work tree either directly or indirectly\&. For example, committing a file followed by checking out the same file should yield the original file in the work tree\&. If this is not the case for the current setting of
\fBcore\&.autocrlf\fR, Git will reject the file\&. The variable can be set to "warn", in which case Git will only warn about an irreversible conversion but continue the operation\&.
.sp
CRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting data\&. When it is enabled, Git will convert CRLF to LF during commit and LF to CRLF during checkout\&. A file that contains a mixture of LF and CRLF before the commit cannot be recreated by Git\&. For text files this is the right thing to do: it corrects line endings such that we have only LF line endings in the repository\&. But for binary files that are accidentally classified as text the conversion can corrupt data\&.
.sp
If you recognize such corruption early you can easily fix it by setting the conversion type explicitly in \&.gitattributes\&. Right after committing you still have the original file in your work tree and this file is not yet corrupted\&. You can explicitly tell Git that this file is binary and Git will handle the file appropriately\&.
.sp
Unfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text files with mixed line endings and the undesired effect of corrupting binary files cannot be distinguished\&. In both cases CRLFs are removed in an irreversible way\&. For text files this is the right thing to do because CRLFs are line endings, while for binary files converting CRLFs corrupts data\&.
.sp
Note, this safety check does not mean that a checkout will generate a file identical to the original file for a different setting of
\fBcore\&.eol\fR
and
\fBcore\&.autocrlf\fR, but only for the current one\&. For example, a text file with
\fBLF\fR
would be accepted with
\fBcore\&.eol=lf\fR
and could later be checked out with
\fBcore\&.eol=crlf\fR, in which case the resulting file would contain
\fBCRLF\fR, although the original file contained
\fBLF\fR\&. However, in both work trees the line endings would be consistent, that is either all
\fBLF\fR
or all
\fBCRLF\fR, but never mixed\&. A file with mixed line endings would be reported by the
\fBcore\&.safecrlf\fR

This feature is useful when an established project should be accepted despite early commits containing errors that can be safely ignored, such as invalid committer email addresses\&. Note: corrupt objects cannot be skipped with this setting\&.

Older versions of Git (before 2\&.20) documented that the object names list should be sorted\&. This was never a requirement; the object names could appear in any order, but when reading the list we tracked whether the list was sorted for the purposes of an internal binary search implementation, which could save itself some work with an already sorted list\&. Unless you had a humongous list there was no reason to go out of your way to pre\-sort the list\&.

The maximum size of a pack\&. This setting only affects packing to a file when repacking, i\&.e\&. the git:// protocol is unaffected\&. It can be overridden by the
\fB\-\-max\-pack\-size\fR
option of
\fBgit-repack\fR(1)\&. Reaching this limit results in the creation of multiple packfiles\&.
.sp
Note that this option is rarely useful, and may result in a larger total on\-disk size (because Git will not store deltas between packs) and worse runtime performance (object lookup within multiple packs is slower than a single pack, and optimizations like reachability bitmaps cannot cope with multiple packs)\&.
.sp
If you need to actively run Git using smaller packfiles (e\&.g\&., because your filesystem does not support large files), this option may help\&. But if your goal is to transmit a packfile over a medium that supports limited sizes (e\&.g\&., removable media that cannot store the whole repository), you are likely better off creating a single large packfile and splitting it using a generic multi\-volume archive tool (e\&.g\&., Unix

When true, Git will use an experimental algorithm for computing reachability queries with bitmaps\&.

OR\-ing them into the result if they exist, ignoring them otherwise), and build up a bitmap at the boundary instead\&.
.sp
When using this algorithm, Git may include too many objects as a result of not opening up trees belonging to certain UNINTERESTING commits\&. This inexactness matches the non\-bitmap traversal algorithm\&.

.sp
If you do not use bare repositories in your workflow, then it may be beneficial to set
\fBsafe\&.bareRepository\fR
to
\fBexplicit\fR
in your global config\&. This will protect you from attacks that involve cloning a repository that contains a bare repository and running a Git command within that directory\&.

safe\&.directory
.RS 4
These config entries specify Git\-tracked directories that are considered safe even if they are owned by someone other than the current user\&. By default, Git will refuse to even parse a Git config of a repository owned by someone else, let alone run its hooks, and this config setting allows users to specify exceptions, e\&.g\&. for intentionally shared repositories (see the
\fB\-\-shared\fR
option in
\fBgit-init\fR(1))\&.
.sp
This is a multi\-valued setting, i\&.e\&. you can add more than one directory via
\fBgit config \-\-add\fR\&. To reset the list of safe directories (e\&.g\&. to override any such directories specified in the system config), add a
\fBsafe\&.directory\fR
entry with an empty value\&.
.sp
This config setting is only respected in protected configuration (see
the section called \(lqSCOPES\(rq)\&. This prevents untrusted repositories from tampering with this value\&.
.sp
The value of this setting is interpolated, i\&.e\&.
\fB~/<path>\fR
expands to a path relative to the home directory and
\fB%(prefix)/<path>\fR
expands to a path relative to Git\(cqs (runtime) prefix\&.
.sp
To completely opt\-out of this security check, set
\fBsafe\&.directory\fR
to the string
\fB*\fR\&. This will allow all repositories to be treated as if their directory was listed in the
\fBsafe\&.directory\fR
list\&. If
\fBsafe\&.directory=*\fR
is set in system config and you want to re\-enable this protection, then initialize your list with an empty value before listing the repositories that you deem safe\&. Giving a directory with
\fB/*\fR
appended to it will allow access to all repositories under the named directory\&.
.sp
As explained, Git only allows you to access repositories owned by yourself, i\&.e\&. the user who is running Git, by default\&. When Git is running as
\fIroot\fR
in a non Windows platform that provides sudo, however, git checks the SUDO_UID environment variable that sudo creates and will allow access to the uid recorded as its value in addition to the id from
\fIroot\fR\&. This is to make it easy to perform a common sequence during installation "make && sudo make install"\&. A git process running under
\fIsudo\fR
runs as
\fIroot\fR
but the
\fIsudo\fR
command exports the environment variable to record which id the original user has\&. If that is not what you would prefer and want git to only trust repositories that are owned by root instead, then you can remove the
\fBSUDO_UID\fR
variable from root\(cqs environment before invoking git\&.

sparse\&.expectFilesOutsideOfPatterns
.RS 4
Typically with sparse checkouts, files not matching any sparsity patterns are marked with a SKIP_WORKTREE bit in the index and are missing from the working tree\&. Accordingly, Git will ordinarily check whether files with the SKIP_WORKTREE bit are in fact present in the working tree contrary to expectations\&. If Git finds any, it marks those paths as present by clearing the relevant SKIP_WORKTREE bits\&. This option can be used to tell Git that such present\-despite\-skipped files are expected and to stop checking for them\&.
.sp
The default is
\fBfalse\fR, which allows Git to automatically recover from the list of files in the index and working tree falling out of sync\&.
.sp
Set this to
\fBtrue\fR
if you are in a setup where some external factor relieves Git of the responsibility for maintaining the consistency between the presence of working tree files and sparsity patterns\&. For example, if you have a Git\-aware virtual file system that has a robust mechanism for keeping the working tree and the sparsity patterns up to date based on access patterns\&.

When set, the fetch or receive will abort in the case of a malformed object or a link to a nonexistent object\&. In addition, various other issues are checked for, including legacy issues (see

.sp
On the receiving side, failing fsckObjects will make those objects unreachable, see "QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT" in
\fBgit-receive-pack\fR(1)\&. On the fetch side, malformed objects will instead be left unreferenced in the repository\&.
.sp
Due to the non\-quarantine nature of the
\fBfetch\&.fsckObjects\fR
implementation it cannot be relied upon to leave the object store clean like
\fBreceive\&.fsckObjects\fR
can\&.
.sp
As objects are unpacked they\(cqre written to the object store, so there can be cases where malicious objects get introduced even though the "fetch" failed, only to have a subsequent "fetch" succeed because only new incoming objects are checked, not those that have already been written to the object store\&. That difference in behavior should not be relied upon\&. In the future, such objects may be quarantined for "fetch" as well\&.
.sp
For now, the paranoid need to find some way to emulate the quarantine environment if they\(cqd like the same protection as "push"\&. E\&.g\&. in the case of an internal mirror do the mirroring in two steps, one to fetch the untrusted objects, and then do a second "push" (which will use the quarantine) to another internal repo, and have internal clients consume this pushed\-to repository, or embargo internal fetches and only allow them once a full "fsck" has run (and no new fetches have happened in the meantime)\&.

By specifying a single suffix in this variable, any tagname containing that suffix will appear before the corresponding main release\&. E\&.g\&. if the variable is set to "\-rc", then all "1\&.0\-rcX" tags will appear before "1\&.0"\&. If specified multiple times, once per suffix, then the order of suffixes in the configuration will determine the sorting order of tagnames with those suffixes\&. E\&.g\&. if "\-pre" appears before "\-rc" in the configuration, then all "1\&.0\-preX" tags will be listed before any "1\&.0\-rcX" tags\&. The placement of the main release tag relative to tags with various suffixes can be determined by specifying the empty suffix among those other suffixes\&. E\&.g\&. if the suffixes "\-rc", "", "\-ck", and "\-bfs" appear in the configuration in this order, then all "v4\&.8\-rcX" tags are listed first, followed by "v4\&.8", then "v4\&.8\-ckX" and finally "v4\&.8\-bfsX"\&.
.sp
If more than one suffix matches the same tagname, then that tagname will be sorted according to the suffix which starts at the earliest position in the tagname\&. If more than one different matching suffix starts at that earliest position, then that tagname will be sorted according to the longest of those suffixes\&. The sorting order between different suffixes is undefined if they are in multiple config files\&.

If no branch is specified and neither
\fB\-b\fR
nor
\fB\-B\fR
nor
\fB\-\-detach\fR
is used, then
\fBgit worktree add\fR
defaults to creating a new branch from HEAD\&. If
\fBworktree\&.guessRemote\fR
is set to true,
\fBworktree add\fR
tries to find a remote\-tracking branch whose name uniquely matches the new branch name\&. If such a branch exists, it is checked out and set as "upstream" for the new branch\&. If no such match can be found, it falls back to creating a new branch from the current HEAD\&.

When using the deprecated \fB[section\&.subsection]\fR syntax, changing a value will result in adding a multi\-line key instead of a change, if the subsection is given with at least one uppercase character\&. For example when the config looks like
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
  [section\&.subsection]
    key = value1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

and running \fBgit config section\&.Subsection\&.key value2\fR will result in
.sp
.if n \{\

    key = value2
