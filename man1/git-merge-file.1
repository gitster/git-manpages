.SH "NAME"
git-merge-file \- Run a three\-way file merge
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit merge\-file\fR [\-L <current\-name> [\-L <base\-name> [\-L <other\-name>]]]
        [\-\-ours|\-\-theirs] [\-p|\-\-stdout] [\-q|\-\-quiet]
        <current\-file> <base\-file> <other\-file>
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fIgit merge\-file\fR incorporates all changes that lead from the <base\-file> to <other\-file> into <current\-file>\&. The result ordinarily goes into <current\-file>\&. \fIgit merge\-file\fR is useful for combining separate changes to an original\&. Suppose <base\-file> is the original, and both <current\-file> and <other\-file> are modifications of <base\-file>, then \fIgit merge\-file\fR combines both changes\&.
.sp
A conflict occurs if both <current\-file> and <other\-file> have changes in a common segment of lines\&. If a conflict is found, \fIgit merge\-file\fR normally outputs a warning and brackets the conflict with lines containing <<<<<<< and >>>>>>> markers\&. A typical conflict will look like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<<<<<<< A
lines in file A
=======
lines in file B
>>>>>>> B
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If there are conflicts, the user should edit the result and delete one of the alternatives\&. When \-\-ours or \-\-theirs option is in effect, however, these conflicts are resolved favouring lines from <current\-file> or lines from <other\-file> respectively\&.
.sp
The exit value of this program is negative on error, and the number of conflicts otherwise\&. If the merge was clean, the exit value is 0\&.
.sp
\fIgit merge\-file\fR is designed to be a minimal clone of RCS \fImerge\fR; that is, it implements all of RCS \fImerge\fR\(aqs functionality which is needed by \fBgit\fR(1)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-L <label>
.RS 4
This option may be given up to three times, and specifies labels to be used in place of the corresponding file names in conflict reports\&. That is,
git merge\-file \-L x \-L y \-L z a b c
generates output that looks like it came from files x, y and z instead of from files a, b and c\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Send results to standard output instead of overwriting
<current\-file>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
Quiet; do not warn about conflicts\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ours, \-\-theirs
.RS 4
Instead of leaving conflicts in the file, resolve conflicts favouring our (or their) side of the lines\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
git merge\-file README\&.my README README\&.upstream
.RS 4
combines the changes of README\&.my and README\&.upstream since README, tries to merge them and writes the result into README\&.my\&.
.RE
.PP
git merge\-file \-L a \-L b \-L c tmp/a123 tmp/b234 tmp/c345
.RS 4
merges tmp/a123 and tmp/c345 with the base tmp/b234, but uses labels
a
and
c
instead of
tmp/a123
and
tmp/c345\&.
.RE
.SH "AUTHOR"
.sp
Written by Johannes Schindelin <johannes\&.schindelin@gmx\&.de>
.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
.sp
Documentation by Johannes Schindelin and the git\-list <git@vger\&.kernel\&.org>, with parts copied from the original documentation of RCS \fImerge\fR\&.
.SH "GIT"
.sp
Part of the \fBgit\fR(1) suite
