.SH "NAME"
git-merge-file \- Run a three\-way file merge
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit merge\-file\fR [\-L <current\-name> [\-L <base\-name> [\-L <other\-name>]]]
        [\-\-ours|\-\-theirs|\-\-union] [\-p|\-\-stdout] [\-q|\-\-quiet] [\-\-marker\-size=<n>]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Given three files \fB<current>\fR, \fB<base>\fR and \fB<other>\fR, \fIgit merge\-file\fR incorporates all changes that lead from \fB<base>\fR to \fB<other>\fR into \fB<current>\fR\&. The result ordinarily goes into \fB<current>\fR\&. \fIgit merge\-file\fR is useful for combining separate changes to an original\&. Suppose \fB<base>\fR is the original, and both \fB<current>\fR and \fB<other>\fR are modifications of \fB<base>\fR, then \fIgit merge\-file\fR combines both changes\&.
.sp
A conflict occurs if both \fB<current>\fR and \fB<other>\fR have changes in a common segment of lines\&. If a conflict is found, \fIgit merge\-file\fR normally outputs a warning and brackets the conflict with lines containing <<<<<<< and >>>>>>> markers\&. A typical conflict will look like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<<<<<<< A
lines in file A
=======
lines in file B
>>>>>>> B
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If there are conflicts, the user should edit the result and delete one of the alternatives\&. When \fB\-\-ours\fR, \fB\-\-theirs\fR, or \fB\-\-union\fR option is in effect, however, these conflicts are resolved favouring lines from \fB<current>\fR, lines from \fB<other>\fR, or lines from both respectively\&. The length of the conflict markers can be given with the \fB\-\-marker\-size\fR option\&.
.sp
If \fB\-\-object\-id\fR is specified, exactly the same behavior occurs, except that instead of specifying what to merge as files, it is specified as a list of object IDs referring to blobs\&.
.sp
The exit value of this program is negative on error, and the number of conflicts otherwise (truncated to 127 if there are more than that many conflicts)\&. If the merge was clean, the exit value is 0\&.
.sp
\fIgit merge\-file\fR is designed to be a minimal clone of RCS \fImerge\fR; that is, it implements all of RCS \fImerge\fR\*(Aqs functionality which is needed by \fBgit\fR(1)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-object\-id
.RS 4
Specify the contents to merge as blobs in the current repository instead of files\&. In this case, the operation must take place within a valid repository\&.
.sp
If the
\fB\-p\fR
option is specified, the merged file (including conflicts, if any) goes to standard output as normal; otherwise, the merged file is written to the object store and the object ID of its blob is written to standard output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-L <label>
.RS 4
This option may be given up to three times, and specifies labels to be used in place of the corresponding file names in conflict reports\&. That is,
\fBgit merge\-file \-L x \-L y \-L z a b c\fR
generates output that looks like it came from files x, y and z instead of from files a, b and c\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Send results to standard output instead of overwriting
\fB<current>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
Quiet; do not warn about conflicts\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-diff3
.RS 4
Show conflicts in "diff3" style\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-zdiff3
.RS 4
Show conflicts in "zdiff3" style\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ours, \-\-theirs, \-\-union
.RS 4
Instead of leaving conflicts in the file, resolve conflicts favouring our (or their or both) side of the lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-diff\-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}
.RS 4
Use a different diff algorithm while merging\&. The current default is "myers", but selecting more recent algorithm such as "histogram" can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant matching lines (such as braces from distinct functions)\&. See also
\fBgit-diff\fR(1)
\fB\-\-diff\-algorithm\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
\fBgit merge\-file README\&.my README README\&.upstream\fR
.RS 4
combines the changes of README\&.my and README\&.upstream since README, tries to merge them and writes the result into README\&.my\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBgit merge\-file \-L a \-L b \-L c tmp/a123 tmp/b234 tmp/c345\fR
.RS 4
merges tmp/a123 and tmp/c345 with the base tmp/b234, but uses labels
\fBa\fR
and
\fBc\fR
instead of
\fBtmp/a123\fR
and
\fBtmp/c345\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBgit merge\-file \-p \-\-object\-id abc1234 def567 890abcd\fR
.RS 4
combines the changes of the blob abc1234 and 890abcd since def567, tries to merge them and writes the result to standard output
.RE
